  One of most clear book on most ambiguous concept of mind. After reading it you can be able to control your mind instead being controlled by it. Best book for people who starts  their day in the hope of a better life but some sudden thoughts and things made them worse.Books us in question and answer form. After reading it you will be a clear person. I bought it just for 180rs.Paper quality average but not misprints that is a good thing.

  ** My First Spiritual Awakening Experience while Reading - The Power of Now ! **I tasted my first awakening while reading Page 53 in the book The Power of Now (Author: Eckhart Tolle) in August 2008 recession in Dubai, UAE. The Power of Now is ""Consciousness on Paper"". This book will be remembered for hundreds of years as ""Spiritual Gift"" to mankind.Attached is the image of that page!I only realized in retrospect that I got awakened in August 2008, in the year 2012 once I went deep into Eckhart’s teaching! I still remember, my thinking stopped while reading this on page 53: “Focus your attention on the Now and tell me what problem you have at this moment… I am not getting any answer because it is impossible to have a problem when your attention fully in the Now”I was absolutely in a miserable state and was not sleeping well for 3 months or so, as my real estate company was going down due to the 2008 financial recession after years of my efforts. I was realizing that I will lose everything and my business will be absolutely destroyed. It eventually got destroyed and it was truly a learning experience!I lost millions in Six months including my properties on palm Jumeriah islands, bank balance and cars!** I LOST EVERYTHING AND I GAINED MY LIFE**But the most magical thing is how that awakening experience took place.Suddenly after that awakening moment, I went into another room where my wife was watching TV and I invite her to dance.My identification with my problems, with money issues broken one by one in that moment. As if all the strings attached to my mind which caused me misery are broken. And I experienced pure awareness once my awareness got released with the identification with mental forms. I felt that I was born again. Literally. I felt so light and I started to cry profusely after i stop dancing with my wife! My wife was a bit confused about seeing me like that. She told me later that she thought I went “crazy” ;)The next day I hand over my Ego's favorite Cars' key to my wife and ask her to drive. Now my wife was 100% confirmed that I went crazy. Why would I give her my favorite car to drive? lol. On our way I was just observing trees on the roads with absolute stillness lying sideways on side seat like a kid. I never watched nature like this as it was a ""waste of time"" for me in my normal state. Usually, in my normal state, I was even scared to sit in car when my wife was driving ..lolWhen I went into my firm/company and start speaking to my people. I felt their feelings just listening to them. As if I can sense what people are feeling. I apologize to one of my people, Natasha, with tears in my eyes for misunderstanding.. I never had any expectations from my employees and i just want to listen to them.Those 5 to 7 days (i don’t even remember how many days exactly) were magical days.My normal consciousness soon took over and from that moment it's going ON and OFF.Later in life I applied same “surrender” principles to my physical pains for lower Brain Tumor surgery and my 4 years intense back and chronic pain and then recovered fullyFor the last 6 years, I left my real estate business! Realization of being withing me its steady and peaceful for last 3 years.Slowly, Slowly I left the path of competitiveness. Also Money now comes easily as in last 6 years i have created assets which giving me passive income so I am financially free too.The point I am trying to make is once you have that awakening , ego will try to delay it by making you extremely ""fearful"" but you need have courage to follow the path and read Eckhart tolle's  books. It will intensify our awakening!I will be glad to know and learn from your first awakening experience if you are willing to share! Thanks

  Purchased this paperback from seller YOURVISION INDIA for the price of ₹218 (₹143+₹75).I received the INDIAN VERSION published by YOGIIMPRESSIONS.The print quality of the cover and the pages are poor. The lines are smudged in certain pages. The quality of the paper is also poor.After comparing it with the original, some of the lines seem to be edited. I don’t know if they edited it because it’s the Indian version or for whatever reasons, it’s not the original ECKHART TOLLE - THE POWER OF NOW.Overall I gave a star for its on time delivery and the other because I could read it at least despite its disappointing quality.People pls share your experiences with different seller as well.

  First I thought I m going to rate this book 5 star but after moved through chapters it contradicts a lot, author fails to explain convincingly about enlightenment, surrender, now etc which makes me to think that author wrote wat he read, felt, realised about his life in this book & not enlightenment. Few contradicts I list 1. Author says self & mind are separate and self is real & constructive where mind is illusion & destructive and to control mind by self, so comatose must be enlightenment you don't have to control ur mind too. 2. Being is transformed starting from big bang to present day includes origin & evolution of living too what its necessity just for being present everything should have its reason. 3. In relationship author contradicts & confuses himself in last three chapters. 4. Author says beyond happiness & unhappiness there is peace, you want(unhappy) you got (happy) & this cycle continues & suffering continues, so peace must be in t cycle not beyond t cycle.

  The publisher of the book mentioned in product description is 'New World Library', but the book I received published by 'Yogi Impressions Books Pvt. Ltd.'. Maybe this is an Indian edition. The paper quality and printing quality of the book are of very low grade which makes difficult to read. The paper is so thin that the print on the backside of the page is visible. The black ink spreads all over the pages. In some pages, the end words in each line not printed completely. In some pages, the printing is too light and faded. In some pages, some of the letters are thicker.I don't mind paying extra money for the book with high-quality paper with rich print quality that inspires to read. I am deeply disappointed with the book quality standard. I'm sincerely requesting Amazon not to entertain books of this quality.

  If you need to read one book in your entire life, it would be the ""Power of Now"".  Though I have read several spiritual classics and seem to understand the teachings it convey, I realized that I did not gather the underlying message portrayed by those great spiritual texts.  It is Eckhart's wisdom showed me what those spiritual texts are actually conveying.The first radical concept, we live only in the Now, takes time to understand, intellectually, we may seem to understand but to put it in practice it is a different story.  We constantly live in the past or future but never in the present.  In fact we never really live in the present moment.  Eckhart in a very crystal clear manner portrays how we live in a dysfunctional way and opens our eyes to the Present.  In the present moment we find our salvation and not anywhere else. If we practice what is presented in the book, we will be giving a present to ourselves.Do buy and read it. I have recommended this book to all my friends.

  There has been a barrage of books about Spirituality and Self-help in recent years and books have been written from East to the West. But luckily the theme mostly remains the same. Which is to stay that at least there is some sort of consensus amongst writers and seekers as to what is essential and what is not. Although the path to achieve that could be different for different cultures, sects, and religions.The Power Of Now deals with one and only one thing that is, how living in now can alleviate most of our problems. This is not the first book that I have read on this topic. A lot about living in now has been written in Zen articles and other books. But the biggest question that you might end up asking after reading any such book is, how practical is it?Tolle writes in the preface that when this book came out it wasn’t appreciated or understood by many and Time magazine could only see it as “Mumbo-jumbo” written about spirituality. And I can very well understand why people who read it back then would have had such a reaction.Today after there has been so much open discussion about these topics and so much literature floating around in the world, some of the words and phrases used by Tolle still seem Mumbo-Jumbo to me.I have no doubt that the author has had great experience and learnings based on which he has written this book. But I don’t like the book much.First, the Q&A format is not conducive to reading. It would have been better if the terms and basic facts would have explained adequately first and in the end, could have dedicated a section for Q&A.Second, its a dry read without examples, parables or stories which makes it difficult to grasp the concepts that the book mentions.Third, the book deals a lot in the abstract. It’s like “you delve deep inside yourself and focus on now, and you have achieved peace.” It’s not easy for a person to undo his years of rote learnings of how to be a better human and achieve whatever you are saying. The book is not at all practical.There have been a few other books and articles on this topic by Buddhist Monks and Zen masters which are much better in terms of making you understand the power of now.Also, the points that are mentioned in the book are drawn a lot from the East. Even the Indian and Chinese spirituality guides talk a lot about this topic and explain it in a much better manner.

  Excellent book. Amongst the best I have read. Can transform the way you live...for the better. The lucidity and depth with which the book explains concepts is amazing. His key message is that Time and Mind are same. Mind forces us to think of past (with regret) and future (with anxiety). Instead live in the present moment, the NOW moment , to be in bliss and consciousness. This is the nutshell, but he explains many other concepts.I very highly recommend this book to everyone. It’s amongst the best books out there.

  The book is fantastic as it narrate the deeper sense of presence. It will give more meaningful visualisation of your past, present and future and explain why Now is more important and past & future are just illusion.

  It's the best spiritual book I've ever read. Ekchart explains how the jobs works and the essence of the presence moment. The best part is that Ekchart never says in this book that we've to follow certain rules and regulations to attain peace of mind but it's something that's characteristically achieved.Ultimately it really brings one's focus to what's really important and what really matters at this given moment therefore rendering anything else powerless.Must read for everyone who are in search for peace of mind!!

  dedicated for each human being on the planet, whether you consider your self a spiritual person or not but one must know (not only know but realize and live) it. the content given in the best possible way. The best book I have ever come across. Beyond only manifesting things in the physical world or training the sub-conscious to be successful. The best book which intended to realize our true self, being. It is not about make some new mind made labels on your self (The labels which your like but not able to have access to those in present)  but about true realization that I am beyond those mind made labels. Leads towards a true liberation. Awake us to say the fundamental truth that the now is the only instance when we have all the access. And many many other things from root. I am really grateful for sharing this knowledge, Thank you eckhart tolle.

  I have given 4 stars because of the belief that everything can be improved. The book gives a metaphysical and spiritual explanation to our insecurity and anxiety about the past and future. I have also read Dr. Albert Ellis ‘a guide to rational living’. Both supplement each other. One giving spiritual and metaphysical explanation and advice while the other a cognitive one.

  The book showed me that I have a pretty thick mold of the mind to break through, and it took me very far on the first day, even farther after that. The message went beyond what I would probably recognize on my own. After all, I was (and still am but to a lesser degree) one of those constant thinkers who mistakenly believe that it's good to think all the time but almost never stop to see, hear and feel the essence of being. Although the message in the book seems familiar and simple, in the end it provided exhaustive answers to the few questions that I had and also those that I wouldn't have thought of before. Amazingly, it also managed not to raise new ones. What it did was grab me by lapels and put me into the present moment. Over and over again, it told me what it means, how to enter it, offered a few different methods, and suggested that with practice many opportunities exist to enter it.

  The serenity prayer (""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference"") is one of the truest pieces of wisdom that can be expressed in so many words. Eckhart Tolle's book shows a way of getting in touch with that wisdom and allowing it to manifest as loving action or bold acceptance through you. Tolle doesn't mince words and doesn't offer illusory comforts. He tells directly that the way to freedom from suffering is to die before you die and to accept all the latent pain that surfaces without judgement. But he also assures that it looks scarier than it is, he describes how to do it, and affirms that what comes afterwards cannot conceivably be matched by anything that the world of ego has to offer. I also see the book as a gentle wake up call for those who have grown a little to enamored with their spiritual journey to be ready to get to the end of it.

  It was while I was reading a book titled 10% happier that I decided to check the POWER OF NOW out. Many months have passed since I read the former. Why did I want to read it? I find myself often browsing through memories in the attic of my mind. I'm also deeply resentful for certain circumstances in my own life. Also, a little bit of guidance has never hurt anyone. Lastly, I am a very curious person who is always looking to find himself or his life situation in other people's words or situations.So what is the power of now?We often compare today to the past, we hold on the to the good and bad moments of the past. The past keeps on living in our mind and nothing we do today is realised to be as good as it was in the past. We hold even the painful moments dearly and are unreleting in giving up. The author? He was 29 years of age when he woke up suddenly one day to realise how green the grass was, how alive and beautiful the trees looked. He hadn't got new glasses to see the world clearly, he just realised the beauty of things. When we are occupied by the past, we are unable to witness the now. I am sitting in a room now with furniture made of wood, the noise of a fan and a machine drilling somewhere. These are there but beyond them there is a silence. Amongst many things, Eckhart Tolle uses and explains words like ""pain body"" , ""Painful moments"" , ""umanifested' , ""unconscious body"" , ""deep sleep"" , ""resentment"" , ""joy"" , ""pleasure"" , ""consciousness"" , ""presence"" , ""being"" ... If anything else, you should know that the past you cling to was a ""now"" once upon a time. Let it go and live in the now. Don't attach relevance to time. Of things you have to do (which causes anxiety) and the things you have done (which causes basis of comparison)The book says a person living in the past or future is limiting himself and causing anxiety. If you have a plan of action and a thing to do, you must not think about it beyond the practicality of it. If you feel, you will only be able to relax and ""live your life"" in the future when your goals have been achieved, then you are lying to yourself. The book expands on how whatever notion, whatever enlightenment, whatever truth you seek to achieve you can achieve right now without making any preparations (physical, monetary, mental, familial) for it.Teachings of the book-> Importance of understanding ""power of now"" and living in the present moment-> Impernaneance of things that might not be as relevant as you deem-> Joy & Pleasure (difference between two)-> Pleasaure & Pain (Cause and effect)-> Unmanifested-> The word ""being"" and how you may never understand it-> The relevance of time dimension-> Ego, there is so much of talk of ego and personality in this book-> Anger, the relevance / irrelevance of bitter resentment-> ""you are not your mind""In chapter three, the author writes: ""In the normal, mind-identified or unenlightened state of consciousness, the power and creative potential that lie concealed in the Now are completely obscured by psychological time. You cannot find yourself by going into the past. You can find yourself by coming into the present. Life is now. There was never a time when your life was not now, nor will there ever be.""Conclusion & Review of book -> I am not someone who gives many books five stars. I am on track to read 50 books this year and this was book 29. It caught me by surprise. I have been advocating its sense to others but mostly I am sharing because I dont wish to forget to inculcate its subject matter in my life. Now that I have finished reading it, I can say that I am happier. There are bits in the book that I am not equipped enough to make sense out of unfortunately. There are also segements where I thought the author is a bit deluded. But the sense he makes in other parts of the book makes it seem as though I am not ready / willing to understand those aspects right now.Will I read it again? I sure will. Maybe I will read the follow up to the book.What have I learned? Read the review again.Request : Click helpful if I was able to add some interest to your thoughts of the book. Click unhelpful if I need to try harder.

  There comes a time when, inexplicably, you are thrown into a tapestry of terrific transformation! The 'Power of Now ' does the same! I have been pouring myself over self-help books ever since my school days. They, in nutshell, talk about the same concepts: thinking, focus, hard-work, intention, success and failures, and what not!'Power of Now', believe me, is beyond all these. Sir Echart Tolle shares an incredibly impactful insight beyond the levels of mind-and-thought based concepts. There is a supreme Consciousness, a ""Presence"", a ""Being"" inside every living being that, if felt and connected, can bring about spiritual depth within us and help us to stay intensely in the ""Present"", in the ""Now""! Our thoughts either fly back into the past or into the future. Only actions remain in the ""Now""! So, if you are really ""thinking"" to explore the cosmic and beautiful reality beyond your ""thoughts"" and intend to stay in the ""now"", the Power of Now can be your lifelong guide!

This book has the power to transform your life and make you enlightened.I've read this book properly and I can feel the sense of change inside me.

  I really liked the book. Unlike other books,  this is written in a question answer format. A good idea!The concept of the ""now"" is perfectly explained by the author. When you first read it,  you might feel that it contradicts our views and opinions but still read it and understand the view of the author. It might be hard to grasp the concepts initially, so I suggest you read it slowly and reread the book twice or thrice. We have a lot to learn from this book.Lastly, I want to say that after reading the book, apply the principles and methods in your life. It will change your life in many ways.

  Dear friend, I am writing this review taking a lot of time and as I believe it has the power to change your life like you know it, like it has been changing mine.First of all this is not just for some spiritual aspirants, as it is pure science of human body, mind and being- explained in a very simple way. It explains how our mind works- thoughts, emotions- cautious and un-cautious mind patterns, how our mind affects our body, actions and many more. It gives you a very simple way to control your thoughts and emotions by passive resistance. Once you understand the science of mind as explained by Eckhart, you will magically increase your inner energy and you can experience it very clearly.I bought this book for self help as I wasn't enjoying the way I am doing things in my life and to live my present moment more intensely, nothing of spiritual reasons to know about myself. But this book disrupted my life the way I know it, pushing me into deep spiritual dimensions and exponentially improving the quality of my life in everyday work in just few weeks.If you have to buy one book in your life buy this one. If you have bought and couldnt realise the power of it, just give it to someone you know, it might change their life. Reading it the third time I am still exploring the depths of this book with my personal experiences. Small (190 pages) and easy to read book.Best wishes

  This is a great book for those afflicted with anxiety, regrets and guilt. The content is not extraordinarily new and has been talked of by many other spiritual masters. Works on mindfulness are similar in terms of the message that Eckhart Tolle is trying to get across. What makes this different is that other works tend to be abstract and hard to understand. Eckhart Tolle uses simple language to make a strong case for being in the present moment. The question and answer format works well as it addresses many questions that readers might have. They seem to have come from his experience of interacting with people curious about his spiritual transformation. The analogies used are great as well such as the one of the eagle and the tree right at the beginning. I would recommend this book to anyone struggling to break out from a pattern of negative emotions. Although, this book can be beneficial for anyone but I feel it would work best for those who are open to similar ideas such as mindfulness.

  Realy fantastic self help book. This book is a gem in both self help as well as spiritual books. But the idea the author has given in this book has been given by an indian saint (Astabakra). Astabakra gita also gives the idea not to be involved in the life but just be a watcher and be happy in life. Because you are not what you think of yourself rather a pure consciousness. After all tolle has described it in layman language which must be appreciated. So friends just be the watcher and feel the consciouness and don't be the victim of unconsiousness(maya). After all we are one consciousness which is menifested in many forms. Have a conscious journey in your life. Thank you.

  I never understood the ""be in the moment"" philosophy before. If you are always in the moment, you'll end up being a blissful vegetable. To do any action you need to think about the future and the past. But Eckhart Tolle manages to explain this philosophy in a very easy to understand way in this book. Definitely worth reading for those who are on a spiritual path.

  This is the first spiritual book I have completed reading.Reading this book is a great experience. After reading for the first time I feel I should read it again and again to fully grasp all the knowledge.The author first convinced me that I'm not the only one facing this problem all my life. It's infact everyone is suffering from the same problem and is seeking solution. So this book resonated very well with me.And guides and clarifies on how to solve the problem heads on. Clearly a lot of work has been done on the book. Every doubt that may arise from the solution is being thought and already answered in question and answer format through out the book.Ah!

  This review is about only content of the book. Go through this book after you've watched Eckhart Tolle videos. It's efficient enough to hold you back from suicide or something very bad. I've read it again and again but some doubts still creep in.This book bring peace and clarity about life but also some doubts. This is a whole new journey which can almost change your thinking and being. Please consider reading it once to make some shifts in your consciousness.

  Being a bibliophile I have read a lot of books while waiting for that one book that can give me a new vision. I am glad to write that I have found my ultimate bliss in a book named ""Power of now"" by Eckhart tolle. People will always tell you that ""Let it go, there are things and people beyond control"". We all know that what we have is only present neither past nor future but this is the book that answers ""How to let it go"", ""Why do you need to let it go"" and ""how one can be enlightened like buddha"". This is the one book that one can read again and again without becoming needy or clingy over a thing or a person.

I guarantee that the perspective about life will change drastically and you will get tears out of joy having found the treasure and at the same time the feeling of pinch as to the miserable quality of life you are leading upto now.

  I bought this book last year and wrote a very small review while my first read. But now I feel that this book deserves a detailed review. This might be long but it might be helpful for a few readers.I had first heard about the book when a famous Canadian singer included this is the list of books that her touched her in any way. I decided to go through more reviews for the book. The book had great reviews everywhere so I decided to order it.I must admit, when I started reading the book I felt lost. I couldn't get what the author was trying to say. Around 15-20 pages later I wondered if the book was not for me. But it seems the author knew that the book might not make sense to a few people initially. That's why he gave a background on how he became a spiritual teacher and how the book would help people get what he wants to convey. I would suggest the readers to NOT skip 'FOREWORD' and the 'AUTHOR'S PREFACE' and to read them carefully as it would tell them how to go forward with the book.Following the author's instructions, I continued reading the book as he mentions that readers may have a few questions initially which may get answered later. Sure enough after a few more pages things started making sense. My questions were slowly answered and the author's words began to have an effect on me. I felt calm and slowly began to experience what the author was trying to say. The effect may not be very profound but it's there. You might need a second read to experience it. I am currently on my second read and things have started making even more sense now.My suggestion would be to read the book slowly and not to rush through the chapters just for the sake of finishing the book. Try to give the words as much attention as you can, even if it means reading just a few pages daily.Don't give up on the book if it doesn't make sense initially. The book is capable of bringing a change in your life.It might take time to finish the book but trust me, it's worth the time.

  A friend recommended this book to me. Simply put, and as the title suggests, it's about discovering the importance of living in the present than dwelling in the past or worrying about the future. The text in general is quite abstract, so I am finding it slightly difficult to read, but given I'm a fairly new reader to books, it should be an okay exercise for regular readers.

  Curiosity is the source of questions to whom we find answers.One thing that I liked about this book is that it is written in a sequential and progressive Questions/answers format which provide a better understanding of the book concepts and also helps in building curiosity.THE MAIN IDEA:------------------------The main idea of this book Is  to live fully in your present moment(THE NOW) not allowing the past and the future to interrupt itWe most of the time think about the things we want in future OR the past experiences we had (bad memories) which creates pain and sadness and thus we don’t appreciate what we have at the present and enjoy itThe author calls it the state of unconsciousness.CONCEPTS:------------------The  author uses various terminologies to provide a clear vision about the concept of nowsuch as :PAIN BODY:The past bad experiences which create pain as we associate our identity with them .PSYCHOLOGICAL TIME:The time (past & future ) that effects  our psyche and our present decision and actions.CONSCIOUS STATE :The state in which we are fully present in the now.UNCONSCIOUS STATE:The state of human in which we are governed by our mind which reacts to the pain body and creates a psychological time.METHODS:----------------The author provides various methods which we can use to become more conscious like:Be fully present in the NOW.MeditationSurrender etc.WHY ONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:-------------------------------------------------------------if you want to enjoy your present fully ,become more conscious and want to end the pain of past and future then you must read this bookIt’s a great read for everyone .I hope this review was helpful in providing the inside of this book.

  Pure consciousness is central to ancient Hindu texts. The concept is abstract and can only be experienced and not understood intellectually. I have read several books in my endeavor to comprehend consciousness that is our true self. This book my Eckhart Tolle has explained it in as simple a way as it can be done. It is our identification with the mind and everything that ceaselessly flows through it every moment, that is the at the root of our dysfunction. This dysfunction causes the mind to either dwell on some past memory or to think about some moment in future time. We never ever live the present moment, the ""now"". If we simply observe the train of thoughts in our mind, we will realize this is true. The only way to still the mental noise and arrive into the 'Now' is by shedding our identification with the mind and assume the role of an observer. When we live in the realm of the observer, the mental chatter begins to subside and we can discover and experience the new dimension of our consciousness.

  This book raises your level of consciousness and the quality of your life will be extremely enhanced if you are able to grasp what is being presented to you. This book can broadly be divided into two parts. The first part makes you aware of the ways in which the dysfunctional egoic minds functions in the individual and collective psyche of humanity. The second part suggests ways to become free of the egoic conditioning and live a life full of awareness, joy and compassion.The effectiveness of this book lies in the practicality of the suggestions presented to the readers. Among the many sections in the book, one section explains how relationships can be used as a spiritual practice and another section contains a unique treasure trove of the most vital information that is very much required for the physical, psychological and spiritual well being of the present day women.You will undergo a transformation if you are able to grasp the contents of this book!

  The only thing you need to heal all your problems and enjoy life is by fully being in the consciousness i.e., being present in that moment. Life can only be lead successfully by enjoying the NOW. The author explains it with simple examples, how to be present.  I loved the sentence which the author says at beginning of the book, ""Can you be free of your mind whenever you want to? Have you found the off button."" He simply puts this way when you have a future plan look at one step at a time. When you at particular situation be there totally. I feel like this book has changed my life by helping me to respond to life situations with inner feeling.  There is a great saying which says, ""Nothing can be taught to you, need to find within yourself"". Books like this will surely help you to bring out the inward power out of YOU.

  I bought it after seeing so many recommendations including recommendations from NY Times and Winfrey, and so many here itself. It is just an OK book for totally naive uninitiated guys, perfect ones livings in west and have no clue on spiritualism. But those who have read Vivekananda's Raja Yoga, Patanjali Sutra, Yog nidra and other works of Satyananda Saraswati, or even OM Swami's books, Yogananda's Gita or OSHO's, Vigyan Bhairav Tantra etc...this book is utterly inferior and stands nowhere near to train you. This book absolutely has no answer for the way world is, how to deal with it. It is monotonously trying to sooth you, how to ignore if anything wrong happens to you. It is an escapist book. But no way answers how to stop wrong and how to become the one who can take on wrong!

  Tolle's 'The Power of Now' is easily one of the best books on spirituality I've ever read. The message is simple and clear - the Present Moment is all that is there - everything else (past,future) is just a thought form. This book drove me to read his other books as well (A New World, Stillness Speaks, Practicing the Power of Now) even though the message is all the same. As Tolle mentioned in some interview(available on Youtube), this book got ""created by itself"" from a space of consciousness within in author. Just sitting and reading this book is pure joy.This is an absolutely beautiful book that will help you discover the true priorities of your life.

Only problems is practical aspect is missing in it. . But how do we conquer the time is using mind as mind alone creates space and time. There is one more aspect of mind is "" inner voice"". . Best part of the book is Question and answer session and it is best possible form of imparting knowledge.  I have no doubt in my mind author is a realsied soul.

  What this book teaches is how to live in the present moment.. Too often we are so obssessed with our thoughts thst we forget to live in and enjoy present..... The author clearly states that present is all that we have and so drifting away from ""now"" creates problems in our life.... I have read his two other books..... He has written them beautifully.... He urges readers to live in the present... That is the main idea but he doesn't tell us clearly how we can do it or may be i failed to capture it......

  The Power of Now is one of the best books on mindfulness - its better than the book which started it all, ""The Miracle of Mindfulness"" by Thich Nhat Hanh. Eckhart Tolle uses a question and answer format to take the reader through the process of living a life which is anchored in the present. Where the book falls slightly short is that is expects one to eschew going into the present or future ever, which is not practical. For eg. if you are working in an office then any kind of projection be it sales, manpower, resource allocation involves the act of trying to peer into the future. Also it expects never to let past interactions influence your present which is silly. For eg. If you have a relative who habitually takes loans and never returns the money then as per this book, if he asks for money then you simply give it without letting his past actions of not returning money influence your decision. Also the fact of the matter is that mindfulness may not work for lot of people and the author's stress that this is the only way might seem a bit arrogant. That said the book offers insight into mindfulness which can be practised in day to day life like when you are walking in the park with family on a beautiful morning then leave the cell on mute, savor a meal without interruptions etc. It can be reclaiming a bit of your life which is now lost to technology and social media.

  A dear friend recommended this book to me and it clearly affected her deeply. I tried really hard to get it, but struggled from the start. It's unbelievably boring. I could barely get through a page before nodding off. It's very repetitive, saying the same thing again and again. It also made so many ridiculous, unsubstantiated, pseudo-scientific assertions it was impossible to take seriously. For example, 'Emotional pain is also the main cause of physical pain and physical disease.' Try telling that to someone with a broken leg! Finally, I found it patronising and unrealistic, with a selfish and self-centred outlook. Anyone with responsibilities - dependent children or parents, a partner, a job, employees, bills to pay, voluntary roles - would be very irresponsible to ignore the future and live purely in the now. I was so relieved to read all the other 1* reviews and find that a small but significant minority felt, as I did, that this book is a pile of tosh.

  Far too much waffle about nothing in my opinion, don't really understand what the author is trying say. It seems he speaks from his own experience.My recommended books areGrow rich While You Sleep by Ben SweetlandTNT: The Power Within by Claude BristolPsycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell MaltzThere's no waffle in these books.Basically get the habit of success thinking instilled in you mind by disciplining yourself to think that way. Initially you have to force yourself to think success thoughts rather than letting your thinking run on autopilot, being influenced by the outside world. The more you force yourself to think success, the more your mind will do it.Thinking habits apparently take 21 days to form so as they say, your result will reflect your efforts.Your subconscious take notice of whatever you think and feel. Rather than listen to the author's videos on YT, I'd recommend listening to Bob Proctor who has studied success thinking for over five decades and was mentored by the late Earl Nightingale. By the way, there's two excellent recordings from Earl Nightingale on YT, The Strangest Secret and the condensed audio of Hill's Think & Grow Rich.

  I ordered this book because so many people said it was a must-read. No, it's not. It's a bunch of rambling. Tolle uses pages and pages of borderline coherent blathering to say what could be summed up in one paragraph.His writing style is unbearable. For example, ""It is a misperception of your essential reality that is beyond birth and death, and is due to the limitations of your mind, which, having lost touch with Being creates the body as evidence of its illusory belief in separation and to justify its state of fear."" JFC.I finally put this book away for good after reading half of it. I really don't understand the book's popularity. It's like everybody is nodding, smiling, and singing Tolle's praises, when the reality is that nobody gets it because there is nothing to ""get."" But nobody wants to say it.

  An incredible book that immediately dispels myths about attitudes that have a profound impact on our relationships and the way we live our lives.This includes beliefs that humanity has reached the pinnacle of its development, that we are completely separate from each other, from nature and the cosmos, and that the physical world is all there is. Based on his own personal transformation, Eckhart brilliantly shows us how to rise above our conscious thoughts and overcome our fears by ending our delusion of time to exist and gain great pleasure from living in the NOW.By watching our thoughts and putting them into the right context, we can remove the insane burden of worrying about a hundred things we will or may have to do in the future, and focus our attention on the one thing that we can do NOW.When we acknowledge and accept the facts and stop reacting to our thoughts, we create the space for transformation to happen. This also applies to giving others the space to express themselves and relinquishing negativity, so that we can feel true compassion and contribute towards bringing about a better world.It is the quality of our consciousness at this moment that is the main determinant of what kind of future we will experience, so to surrender is the most important thing we can do to bring about positive change. When we surrender to what IS and so become fully present, the past ceases to have any power and we do not need it anymore  - presence is the key to the power of NOW.

  I was expecting so much from this book, given how great the reviews are, but I was hugely disappointed. I consider myself to be “psychologically minded” and therefore receptive to the kind of concepts this book purports to address. However, I found that the book totally lacked any real direction and offered nothing more than page after page of incomprehensible, unstructured and useless drivel. The condescending tone which the author adopts throughout the book quickly becomes irritating and it was a real test of my patience to continue reading all the way to the end. But the real problem for me was how it continually failed to deliver on what it claimed to offer: guidance on how to live more in the present and shut the brain off from worrying about the past and future. It often felt like I was reading an extended introduction to the book, rather than the book itself, as most of its content is devoted to explaining how people suffer from the problem of not living in the present, what impact this has and why it is so important to change the way we think. But the key guidance missing is an explanation of exactly HOW we can make such changes. I genuinely cannot understand how this book has been able to receive such positive reviews, although I am reassured to read a large number of other reviews similar to mine.

  I was led to this book from reading various other spiritual books, such as by the excellent Jack Kornfield, and following some of the daily meditative posts on social media such as instagram. I was very surprised that amazon informed me that I had purchased it previously, on exactly the same date, 13 years before! It obviously did not speak to me then but it certainly does now. An amazing book that will completely change your viewpoint on life and the way you choose to see it/live it and once changed, you can't go back.

  But also one of the most difficult to understand at first (even though the author says that I must try not to understand!). I read this book in two phases with about a month's break halfway through. Because, for someone new to spiritual readings, the whole concept was very new for me. However, the last 3 chapters all made the book click and suddenly everything became clear to me. I have since listened to it on Audible several times and read the odd chapter here and there. Like a good movie, I learn something new each time I go back to it. I think this book is a must for everybody.

  I was feeling suicidal and had been for two years. I was completely done with life, with trying to heal my emotional traumas, limitations and with trying to be a full-functioning adult. I felt trapped inside an endless corridor of meaninglessness and pain.The Saturday morning when I was contemplating really ending it, I heard an inner voice say ""one last book, read one last book and if you still want to kill yourself, go ahead."" This was my ""last book"" I read it three months ago and haven't returned to that dark and hopeless place yet.It taught me how to disconnect from the insanity of the mind. I had spent my life reading thousands of books trying to ""figure it out"" to make my way to a place of happiness and functionality, what Tolle explains that trying to solve the problems of thought from the level of thought is an impossibility. When we let go of mind-consciousness we do not become a meditative vegetable, instead, we gain access to the consciousness of our whole body and a more advanced awareness. I know it sounds weird, but it works. When I can stay present everything I do becomes more effective, and my social skills are way better now then they have ever been.I don't mean to say that this is the be-all and end-all to human growth, but it has in fact saved my life, so I figured it at least deserved a good review.

  Assumption: Eckhart Tolle is enlightened. Supposedly he had an epiphany after a long spell of severe depression which resulted in his non dual realisation.Since this book is a blend of esoteric wisdom I wonder... Did Tolle study esotericism before or after his epiphany?My problem with this book is its claim that you can achieve enlightenment by using The Power of Now. You can't.If the book was simply a call to live more mindfully it would be more honest. Sadly it's pretentious beyond words and to the uninitiated I imagine it's a load of gobbledygook.

  I was so disappointed in this I don't even know where to start... 200 some pages of a topic that's really quite important however written about using a tone so condescending it actually made me angry.  Seriously, he actually breaks up the text with a symbol which upon seeing you should ""feel and experience the truth of what has just been said"".  It's safe to say I will never read another Eckhart Tolle book ever again and will stick with authors who wish to help and not patronise.

If you are not ready, you won't get it.  You have to go through a lot of suffering in your life to really grasp it. It is not because people are dump, spirituality is not for everybody.

  I understand the main point behind the book, focus on now and dont let past/future mess you up. However, the book is very repetitive and I find myself reading this ‘main message’ in different words throughout the book all the time. I mean, its not like he repeats it in every chapter etc., its in every paragraph, sometimes 5-6 sentences on the same page are saying the same thing. I don’t know how people gave it 5 stars and its so popular. It doesn’t really give you any directions to how to find ‘now’, it just keeps saying you need to focus on now and blames you if you cannot find it 😂

  Let me start off this review by highlighting that I am not the typical buyer of spiritual books. I am a 23 year old student who spends a lot of my time at boxing training or reading about entrepreneurship for my degree.This book is truly life changing. I can understand why numerous people struggle with it, give up, and end up giving 1* reviews. One of my best friends who I spoke to about it gave up 30 pages in for the same sort of ‘it’s too wishy washy’ reasons. He is now re-reading it after I have strongly encouraged him to do so.This book is incredibly deep, and not something you can try and skim read like other books. It requires intense focus and slow reading to fully grasp the concepts in discussion. However, it is truly a masterpiece which observed perhaps the biggest modern ill in today’s world - the inability to switch off. (Both from external stimulus, and our own compulsive and often unconscious inner chatter).If you have tried to read this book and struggled, I invite you to take a more open minded approach towards it and perhaps contemplate whether you are so far invested into your minds form ego, that you fail to see the value, or even the possibility, of being present with a much deeper consciousness of your being.To anyone who is reading the reviews here and is unsure whether to purchase due to a minority of poor reviews, I could not recommend the book any higher. It will change your life dramatically, as well as the lives of the loved ones which surround you.

  I don't know what to say about this really.... there are some really good, simple ideas for reducing stress. The underlying principle is that most us spend far too much time worrying about what has happened before or what might happen in the future. Therefore to reduce stress we need to focus on now... because chances are, right now, everything is ok. I liked this idea but found the rest of the book a bit of a challenge....I listened on audible and it is narrated by the author. He has a nice calm voice but it's in a question and answer format and the people asking the questions frequently annoyed me. Tolle comes across as knowing the answer to everything in the world and has managed to find all the answers to everything and can explain why lots of religious texts have been misinterpreted over the years... but he has found a way to understand it all. His ideas about women and the 'menstrual flow' are a bit weird.Towards the end I found the author to be a bit of a patronising know it all.... which is a shame... because the initial and most basic principles make a lot of sense. I think this is a good idea but when padded out with all this extra stuff about religion, gender, illness etc it loses credibility for me. I will use the power of now... I'm using it already... but I don't think I really needed any more than the first two chapters.

  Firstly, this book cannot simply be read; it must be experienced. For many, this idea of Being is so deeply clouded by thought, they cannot access it. Many will become frustrated, like some of the one-star reviewers. If you're not ready,I think this book is unlikely to be beneficial for you.For those who are ready to embrace this incredible journey and awaken, this book helped tip me into a true state of presence that I'd only previously experienced in glimpses. The peace that comes with it is so beautiful. For something that can't be expressed or explained through words--something so inconceivable--Eckhart Tolle's writing is so powerful in directing us to that place.

  It’s just a load of rubbish. I’m not going to dance around the fact.This book tries, in the author’s own words, to explain how being present in the moment can bring you happiness and a “higher level of consciousness”.The problem is the Toll consistently speaks in absolutes and matter of factly descriptions when in-fact 95% of what he says in his book is his interpretation of how the mind works and how to use  it. He consistently uses spiritual analogy to explain accepted psychology concepts such as the subconscious mind, depression and anxiety. He claims that the solution to all these different problems is through the state of being in the present moment.The state of being present in moment is NOT a new  concept, and this book is not revolutionary.You would be much better suites to reading into and practicing meditation and taking it a step further into Buddhism and Zen philosophies if you wanted. I would also recommend reading into psychology and the science into real things that can effect your state of mind and ‘being’. Such as:.Exercise.Diet.Meditation.Mindfulness.Breathing.Sleep.Personality disorders.Mental health issues.Addiction.Abuse of dopamine (aka toomuch pleasure).How the mind works (the subconscious, left vs right brain, the prefrontal cortex etc).How to have fulfilling relationshipsI could go on but the point it this book doesn’t present any new ideas. It is a book of analogies, absolutes and mostly pseudoscience waffle. Save your self the time and money and research how to become happy through science and living your life through your own eyes.Thanks,Henry

  I have over 25 years of experience as a clinical psychologist. This is hands down the best self-help book I have ever come across, and can not fathom why the very simple and straight-forward concepts Tolle presents were never once mentioned in my grad school training or any of the countless professional development workshops I have attended over the years. If you are dealing with depression and/or anxiety, this is the book to get. But you need to read it slowly, to take it in bit by bit, and actually pause to practice what he is explaining in each section to benefit from it. You can't just skim it and expect to understand it in a way that will open your life and help you experience the freedom and ease of this very moment. I keep it by my bed and re-read sections all the time. Thank you Eckhart!

  UGH.  I was so looking forward to reading this book.  I really wanted to learn something from it. I was truly hoping Tolle would change my life.  I heard his name a lot from various ""enlightened"" individuals and I remember an interview with him on the Oprah show.  Well, I couldn't read past the first chapter.  It didn't resonate with me.  I like reading about practical practices on bettering oneself. This one was way too new age-y and the tone was condescending.  There's a lot of corny passages and long paragraphs that don't make sense.  It made me feel dumb.  It's suppose to make me realize that I should start living in the ""now"".

  What can you say about this book? It is life transforming. That is not hyperbole. Oprah Winfrey, apart from being a very intelligent woman, is also from the school of hard-bitten journalism, and she sincerely believes that Eckart Tolle is a prophet, not less important than a lot of the old biblical prophets. I agree with her. There is no reason why human beings with phenomenal insight cannot exist today in the same way as 3000 years ago. Perhaps today there is even more need to respect that insight. If you are in the slightest bit interested in the purpose of our lives on this earth or want to find a far better way to manage your everyday life, those things are within this book.

  This is the only book/thing that has ever come close to trying to explain what it is to be 'present' or just how to 'be'. And therefore how to find peace. I think you'd struggle to understand this book if you haven't felt that experience of just 'being', and you can do this by just practicing meditation for 5 mins for at least 3 days (try headspace app). When you read this book you'll really understand how it all connects. It's not religious or has a 'secret message', but just understanding how being present is the best path to joy is great and I feel this book covers that well. Everyone should read it.

I read the entire book in 3 days and I can understand why many people aligned with the philosophy of the book.

  I am a fan Tolle's work so I'm a little surprised and disappointed by this read.The essence of the book, like the majority of spiritual books is to be conscious of your mind so that it do not take you out of the present moment, where life is. Simple yet profound teaching.The area I had a problem with is perhaps the style the information is presented in. The whole book is written on a question and answer bases. This is really disruptive to the flow of writing and also feels less intimate. I usually have about 5 books each month on the go and am pretty strict with myself to complete them all yet this was the one I felt constantly reluctant to pick up and read. It felt like a lot of work. Perhaps it needs to be more condense. I don't know - something was missing for me although the philosophy of the book is very significant and powerful.

  Historically, the most basic things in life are simple and easy to accomplish. Eating, sleeping and drinking too name a few. What I had no idea was that being in the present moment is also very easy if you practice.Eckhart constantly reinforces the need to be in the Now, which then means your ego starts to dissolve and you become more aware of your ego and the thoughts that you have are not actually who you are, they are the ego.Once you become more aware and present, you begin to see that your thoughts can be dissolved and you are sale to avoid conflict both internally and externally, and all you have to do is spend more time in the present, everything else you happens naturally, it's that easy as the present is always here and Now.

  I have read many Buddhist, Daoist works, as well as Shamanic, Christian,  Hindu and Sufi texts, but the directness, simplicity and plain modern english of this book is hard to better. The truths are not new. The truths are timeless. They are descriptions of the 'IS',the 'NOW', the present. What ever it is that you are currently experiencing. The only difference is how clearly, pure or unfiltered your experience is. Often it is biased, filtered, or interpreted by your on beliefs, perceptions and mental habits. This book helps to clarify how to sense it directly or at least more clearly than your usual way. Though I will admit this is the third time I have read it, and five years on from the first time.

  Have read, watched and listened to Mr Tolle for many scores of hours.One night Mr Tolle may have blew a fuse, had some type of breakdown. Due to too much study. (Possibly he was hyperventilating just before he collapsed? )He was 29 years of age at the time, fluent in 3 languages and had a degree in English,  German is his native tongue. Studying for a PhdThe next day he stopped studying, and reading, and looked around.He much preferred this post breakdown state and so, not surprisingly, never returned to his Phd.  Claims he went abroad  looking at global spiritual teachings to explain his breakdown?Sounds to me he may have had an idea for a book even before he broke down. Did he knowingly set out for quotes etc, etc, that fit his story? (Alan Watts published a book on Zen in 1957.Other books and recordings  on any subject were available. Travelling abroad makes for a better story. )What does one mans interpretation of some 2,000 - 3,500 year old texts prove?Surprisingly, if you grasp what he writes and says, he changed his name, due to it having; ""too much baggage""!  Was a catholic, up to about the age of 11. Also mentioned, his ;""prayers did not get answered.""  Enjoys an audience.

  So, this book seems so logic and mostly everything you read makes immediately sense. However! Putting it into your daily life and try to live it... that's the hard part and I have certainly a long way ahead of myself. It doesn't enlight you BUT gives the simple truth on how we as humans mostly work... That our mind is a beautiful and yet somehow ""destroying"" tool, which is basically just afraid of the moment, or the next one more likely. I already ordered the practising book of the power of now, because after reading this I definately need a practising book!If you are not that religious type of person you need to be aware of that from time to time the word ""God"" appears, which kinda bothered me somehow as I only had the ""learned in school"" point of view of Jesus etc. Nevertheless it certainly does give you a new perspective which I never thought of. However, it did bother me a bit reading it, that's the reason for giving 4 stars.I'm German and I didn't have any problems reading it! It is fluently written, you need, however, time and a lot of focus not only to read but to understand what is being sad.I definately would recommand this book to people who are interested in other perspectives and are not satisfied with the modern lifestyle and looking for something more. You need to be open-minded than that this book is an eye-opener!However, the work isn't being done with only reading it ... guess it's only the start!

  The central message is that the root of our emotional problems is our habit of identifying too much with our minds.  The past and the future are creations of thought - only the present moment is real and only the present moment matters. The core of who you really are is that part of you that can watch yourself thinking and by this be present. Tolle sounds a clear note stating that happiness comes from a state of consciousness and a connection with being present to the wonder of life. This is why it gets 4 stars.However, this book is full of metaphysical nonsense and the core message is in the first 3 very short chapters that are worth the purchase price. The rest is just...

  I was really disappointed in this. I've always found the authors contributions in online videos and podcasts to be interesting. The book is very repetitive and, in summary, suggests to focus on the now. If you've read anything on mindfulness then you'll find this book rather superficial with a lack of any real objective supporting evidence. The talk of opening 'portals' and 'unmanifestation' was unconvicing. I'll be avoiding his other work if his narrative is of similar standing to this. I'm surprised how well received this has been over the 20 years.

  YOu will never be the same after reading this book. It is not for the faint-hearted, but reads fairly easily and you will not read this content, I think it is fair to say, anywhere else. This is along the lines of the Law of attractioj, but then a step further, finding your epace within, living in the now and first learning to give up chasing your desires and your ego and listening to your mind and being in the moment that is as it is, the rest follows anyway.

Admitadly, I heard this the first time on Audio Format and I didn't like it. It was only hype that made me give it a second go, and I am glad I did!Be careful, when you read you will experience fight back from the ""ego"". Tolle even says in the first pages, be aware of your emotions as you read. This is vital. When you read someting like this your ego will do all it can to put you off. Throw out old memories at you, remind you of some guy at work who you want to punch etc. Just keep reading and stay aware and when you are done..... read again!!!!

  Endless paragraphs of psychobabble, rambling on and on without ever making lucid points.

  I'm an over-thinker and used to analyze past events way more than I should have. I had a difficult time not focusing on the past. I found this book really helped with that, in focusing on right now. I still look back on the past, but I don't dwell on it like I used to. I've become much better on focusing on right now. Besides focusing on the past, this book has really helped with my lists; yes, I'm a list maker. I make lists of things I need to do at work, lists of chores, lists of tasks that need to be done around the house. These lists used to overwhelm me. Now, I make out my lists, I break it down into items that NEED to be done today, then I look at that list and say to myself, ""What needs to be done right now?"" I do that task and once complete, come back to my list and ask the same question. What I didn't like about this book: I'm not a religious person or even really spiritual. I found the end of the book to get extremely religious. If you're prepared for that, I highly recommend this book.

I think it is very difficult to talk about something that the thinking mind can never really comprehend, and yet somehow Mr Tolle managed to write a book that anyone, who is interested in the subject can understand and learn from. I am not surprised at all that so many people claim that this book has changed their lives (though it was obviously not the book itself but their inner 'work' that did the change): this book has a very clear message and some very practical suggestions.The only slightly negative thing I found was the many repetitions of the same message.

  This book is a fantastic read for those wishing to explore themselves and the way in which we percieve the world. It is a thought provoking book and an enjoyable read. Most of the statements or ways of thinking are supported by the authors thinking and how they came to this conclusion. It is an open book and philosophy which makes it approachable and inspires curiosity. It does however make sweeping statements on some subjects which let it down by deviating from the philosophy to attack certain other philosophies or theories, which i feel were unecessary. In short it is 100% a must read but it is not the end of your journey or give you all the answers that some say it will probvide.

  It’s a brilliant book, and it really helped when I needed it most. It made things make sense that had been tearing me apart, it lifted a weight from me, brightened my eyes, and helped to make me smile again at the world and people. A lot resonated with me, some bits were a little over my head but maybe I’m not ready for those parts yet.If someone reads the book, and doesn’t really get it, I don’t think they need it, or in a place in life where they need it and are ready for it. If you are struggling, it’s the perfect handbook to read over and over again.

  Shame there isn’t a one star option. This book has been written purely to progress the pathetic fictitious ideology of the author. They’re either completely and utterly mad, or they’re taking advantage of those who genuinely need some form of help and guidance for their own selfish benefit. These sort of books should not be published. It isn’t written well, the entirety of the book contains no factual or scientific evidence of the author’s opinion. Shame on you.

  This is simply the best insight available today. Tolle distills all the noise of religious and esoteric thought and gets right to the heart of what it all means and how to connect to it. The critical approaches of some reviews, finding it biased toward the materially comfortable West looking for spiritual fulfillment like a spoilt child, have missed the point and depth of this seemingly simple and beautiful work. Be assured, the message is profound.

  I liked the exercises designed to help you stay in the 'now' and be at one with your own body.  I think that the author is over optimistic that using this method will automatically turn you into a good person.  There have been many instances of people using these methods for bad purposes.  The Kybalion contains a very specific warning on this subject.  People must approach the methods in 'Power of Now' with the deliberate intention of doing good.

Should be standard issue on schools' curriculum for PSE or for anyone currently receiving or waiting for treatment for any kind of emotional health problem, regardless of pathology. Also recommend the companion book, Practising the Power of Now, as a potted version of Eckhart Tolle's sage advice and insight.

When, for a short time, I actively chose to move away from it, feeling that I could do some good in the short term, I wonder whether I actually did any good, and it was certainly not good for me.I have recommended it to many friends. Now I am glad of the opportunity to recommend it more widely.

  Love the book, however already sourcing an older edition in hope that the print / font will be larger. I have a poor eyesight and found this book to be printed in the poor quality paper in very small font. It is a shame that such a good book is produced so poorly, this kind of book should be kept by ones bedside,  and should be something special...

  Love this book which is so wise. Having greedily absorbed its message once, I dip into it regularly and It reminds me to reconnect to my still centre. It is very empowering.It follows the philosophy of Baba Ram Das - 'Be here now' but is written in a very positive and compelling way. A great self help book for those interested in meditation and self improvement.

  I enjoy reading books on spirituality, philosophy, religion, happiness and psychology so this book obviously stood out for me. Once I started reading, the experience was a bit negative as it had been hyped up so much (maybe?)... I also didn't take to the author as well as others I have recently read.......... However........... as I read on, I really really enjoyed opening up my view to some of the author's ideas. Some of which were completely new to me, others were principles I knew but put into practise. I'm now reading the first few chapters and enjoying them more so this time around.Well worth a purchase/read...... what have you got to lose by doing so?

  This is the book that has truly changed my life. Unburdened me from the baggage of over thinking. Created that gap that has allowed peace to enter my mind. I can't be happier or more creative and focused. Still learning to be present on situations but it takes practice. Opened my eyes for sure and boosted my confidence.

  Let me preface by saying that I really like Eckart Tolle.Part of the experience, is watching the man manipulate silence, the tone and projection of his voice, his demeanor. None of this comes across in the book.I've given the book a high rating because of my esteem for him as a spiritual teacher, and my purchase is a way of saying thanks. However, there is nothing better than being able to see him with my own eyes and hear him with my own ears. It's a completely different experience.The message is the same, but the real benefit of the experience is in watching how he delivers it in person. At least, it is that way for me.Maria

  This book really can change your thought process, even if you're just a regular person like me.  The book is not linked to any belief system which makes it of use to a person of any faith, in my view.  Some of the things the author says might startle to begin with, but perservere and you will be rewarded.  It really has changed my way of thinking and improved my mental health.  But of course, you have to work at it.  If your thoughts are making your life a misery, give this book a go.

  Nel 2003 ero in Tailandia, c'era stato lo tsunami, su una spiaggia lontana dalla tragedia un ragazzo olandese legge un libro. Mi dice che devo assolutamente leggerlo. Il libro ripete sostanzialmente sempre la stessa identica cosa, e lo fa di proposito, perché così fanno i mantra tibetani e in fondo il libro è ispirato inin parte dalla filosofia zen. Lo trovo geniale nella sua capacità di sintetizzatore millenni di insegnamenti spirituali di tutte le religioni, affiancarli ai riferimenti culturali occidentali.e offrirli come chiave per affrontare il presente che viviamo. Perché l'unica cosa reale è adesso. Il resto è solo un' illusione, un costrutto della mente, la quale ci inganna e ci imprigiona. Il ragazzo olandese aveva ragione...forse non cambia la.vita ma per quanto mi riguarda traccia una sentiero chiaro e spazza via un sacco di miraggi a cui crediamo nostro discapito. Ho notato che per tanti questo libro è faticosissimo da leggere e/o è solo un mucchio di stronzate e la faccia del signor Tolle è impresentabile. Ecco, se c'è una cosa che ti lascia questo libro, è quella  di non giudicare a raffica sulla base di pregiudizi. I pregiudizi sono comodi perché sono mattoncini di pensiero pre-frabbricati, che ci impermeabilizzano dalla fatica di affrontare le cose per quello che sono, il che però è l'unica salvezza possibile.  Secondo me, questo libro è un piccolo capolavoro. 5 stelle ++

  Excellent read, has changed my life for the better and will continue to do so as long as I continue to practice presence. This was a really slow read for me as I found I needed time between chapters to soak it all up and accept it. Many physiological issues I battled with like anxiety and depression have dissolved.I found this book more effective than CBT and counciling as it gets right to the route of the problematic human mind.Can't wait to get started on Eckhart's next book.

  What a remarkable book, i've been suffering a lot of stress lately and this book helps you put a completely new slant on things. It opens your mind to not worrying about the past and to deal with stress as it happens and not think to far ahead. Iv'e never been a reader because i get bored reading, but with this book i couldn't put it down, it's changed my whole outlook on life. Buy this book and live in the now, it's working for me.

  Wonderful and life-changing. Eckhart Tolle explains clearly just why living in the present moment is crucial to the wellbeing of all of us, and how much we miss of life by not doing so. Very highly recommended.

  I have read many of these type of books but this one stands head and shoulders above any of the others. I read it at a very difficult time in my life and it kept me grounded and focused when everything felt like closing in on me. Keep it as reference when you are finished reading it as there will be many times you need to go back to it. For the first time in my life I have found spirituality.

  I gave it to a good friend and his comment was ""it is good if you have had some hardship that you need to get over"".  Interesting but I can't agree.  This book is a very powerful refocus of what's important in life, whether you are having the best time ever (guess what, it won't last, and that's OK) or the worst time (again, it won't last, and that's OK).  But more importantly, to elevate yourself above that whole paradigm of good/bad times, and just live.  Live in the present.  Love this book and all it stands for.  Nice work.

  Our minds sometimes are our worst enemies and Tolle captures this very well. The thesis anti-thesis style worked for me but some of the more spiritual stuff got in the way a bit. However I enjoyed the book and learnt from it. I cannot exactly describe the peace of being truly present in the now but I have experienced the stress of worrying about the future and regretting the past and I think many readers would understand this.

  Hi,At first I found it very hard to get into this book. Thought I wasn't very intellectual so couldn't get to grips with it. I kept going and a good bit into the book I began to understand it. I now know what the author is talking about. I haven't finished it yet. Gave myself a few weeks to think about what the author is saying. When I complete it I will have to re-read it then see if the beginning is clearer.

  was recommended this by my counselor. Book came in perfect condition, quickly by the seller, hence the 3 stars, the book itself is why the lower star rating. anyone who lived their life like Tolle suggests, would either be a Buddhist monk, or a sociopath. I can glean the idea he is getting to, and utilize it to a point, but i wouldn't ever want to be as seemingly cold and uncaring/indifferent/unemotional about life as he tries to tell us to be.

  It’s a rather fabulous book in the way it is designed and written. I think that anyone who us searching for a way to break the patterns of their life could benefit from reading this book.I found myself laughing in moments (even though it’s not supposed to be funny). The amusement comes from the reality of how obscure some of our fundamental beliefs are.Paraphrasing  an example in the book explaining how there is no past or future, there can only be now ...“If you ask an eagle or a bear, what time is it, they would say the time is now and think, what a stupid question.”Brilliant book & great audio.

  Ich stand Eckhart Tolle jahrelang sehr kritisch gegenüber und habe mich dementsprechend immer geweigert ihm auch nur eine Chance zu geben. Dank dem Leseprobeservice habee ich mich vor wenigen Wochen doch für das Buch entschieden und kann dieses nun jedem wärmstes weiterempfehlen.Ich mag mich irren aber Eckhart Tolle gehoert nun zu den wenigen Autoren, welchen ich wirklich Glauben schenken kann, was deren Erfahrungen angeht.Mir hat das Buch zahlreiche Wege aufgezeigt, mich selbst weiterzuentwickeln. Die vom Autor geschilderten Ansichten sind in sich sehr schlüssig und regen stark zum nachdenken und überdenken der eigenen Ansichten an.Schönes Buch!

  Nach dem Durchwühlen von unendlich  langen Schachtelsätzen gelangt der geistige Masochist zu einer Kernaussage von Tolle:Die Vergangenheit und die Zukunft sind nur psychologische Zeit, existieren eigentlich nicht. Daher kann man seineEntscheidung nur im unmittelbaren Jetzt treffen und bei voller Konzentration auf die Handlung kommt das Ergebnis von selbst.Es bedarf viel Geduld um sich durch die Schwulst seiner Erklärungen zum Kern seiner Aussagen durchzuarbeiten.Es ist eine tolles Werk mit anregenden philosophischen Ansätzen. Man könnte etwas mehr gliedern und die Schachtelsâtze kürzen.Ein Zitat aus diesem Buch, das alle Kernaussagen beinhaltet:Nimm alles an, was auf dich zukommt, gewebt im Muster deines Schicksals, für was könnten deine Bedürfnisse besser passen.Marc Aurel

  I would recommend this book to anyone experiencing stress, illness or dissatisfaction with life. The message is so simple but incredibly powerful. Tolle explains that we are all the victims of our tendency to think and analyse constantly. We flit from thinking about the past to anticipating the future and in doing so we miss the 'now'. Most of us go through life in this state of 'unconsciousness'. The key idea proposed by Tolle is that we can become fully 'conscious' and become free from the constant buzz of stress and worry by focussing our awareness on the present.I read this during hospital treatments and each time I picked up the book and started to read I felt a deep sense of calm and peace.  Tolle is so clearly right when he says that the past is gone and the future is not yet here - the only experience we have is NOW.  The key to enlightenment is 'being' rather than 'thinking'.The only criticism I would make is that the writing style can come across as a bit pretentious and pompous, but look beyond that to the message and you will gain from reading this book.

  Meh. Expected something different. There was something so unclear about his writing, like he's trying to reach anyone's attention with contradictory statements.I found it was an over spiritual a bit snobby and unsetteled writing with very little amount of accuracy. This could be disputable, of course, as the book isn't publicly known for it's scientific exactness. Maybe I'm just not enlightened enough but I didn't like it and I was expecting to love it.

  Dieses Buch ist bekannt als Bestseller, und viel Wörter voll des Lobes und der Begeisterung wurden schon geschrieben.Als ich mich weiter mit dem Thema auseinandersetzte, merkte ich, dass Tolle natürlich auf viele Konzepte und Ideen nicht von selbst gekommen ist. Das Wissen ist quasi auch ohne ihn vorhanden. Was Tolle auszeichnet, ist jedoch die Vermittlung an den zeitgenössischen Leser! Ich finde es keine Übertreibung, wenn es auf dem cover heißt ""every sentence rings with truth and power"" (Jeder Satz erstrahlt in seiner Wahrhaftigkeit und Kraft (eig Übersetzung)).Es hilft jedoch nichts, einfach an die Kraft des Buches zu glauben, und zu denken, bloß weil andere es gut finden, sollte es bei mir auch etwas bewirken. Die Botschaft sollte einen direkt ansprechen, und falls einem das Buch nicht einleuchtet, dann ist das so. Daher finde ich das Frage Antwort Format sehr passend.Und das Buch gilt nur als Anregung, will ich einmal sagen. Es muss mit Taten gefüllt werden. Und wirklich gelebt werden.

  I rather boringly have to agree with nearly everyone else here and say that this book is a life changer if you don't already understand this stuff. Importantly, this book will give you a structured way to relax properly and put things into perspective.The ideas in this book certainly are not new in any way. The story at the beginning of the book where Tolle says he finally came up with The Answer sitting homeless on a park bench is, frankly, laughable considering he studied theology for so many years. However, this story is good at bringing the reader into the narrative. And this is where Tolle excels. He REALLY is able to get these complicated ideas about life the universe and everything across in a few simple pages.If you are currently in a period of crisis, this is definitely the book for you. As Tolle says, the can be no better time to discover enlightenment during a low point.

  Excellent.  I think every word is absolutely true to this man and I feel he makes very valid points.  Tolle writes the book in the format of a very long conversation, with breaks when something profound needs a little extra thought, in the form of a large, squiggly 'S'.The book doesn't feel like a long conversation at all, though.  It is a very smooth read and makes total sense.I really do think every one should read this extroadinary book.

  Ich wollte nie etwas von Tolle lesen, weil ich meinte, dass ein weithin berühmter ""Guru"" irgendwelches sogenanntes lichtvolles Geschwätz von sich geben würde, aus dem man alles und Nichts entnehmen kann. Doch wurde ich eines Besseren belehrt.Tolle schreibt aus Kenntnis des üblichen psychologischen und ebenfalls buddhistischen Wissens-und Erfahrungsschatzes in gut lesbarer, verstehbarer Form, ohne je banal zu werden. Er beschreibt u.a. den Prozess, wie ""man"" einen ""pain-body"" entwickelt, sich darauf fixiert, sich damit identifiziert und schließlich, wie der ""mind"" vermeidet, sich auf das Hier, Jetzt und auf Freude des Seins einzulassen, nie wirklich präsent ist. Es werden die Unterschiede zwischen dem gewöhnlichen und dem tiefen Bewusstsein erläutert und wie ""man"" in schwierigen Lebenssituationen den Klärungen der Lebensphase, nach der man sich andererseits sehnt und die erforderlich ist,  ausweicht, sie verdrängt. Dieser Widerstand intensiviert das Leiden an der Situation und bringt akute Angst, Aggression, Depression und/oder Krankheiten zu Tage. Toller bietet die üblichen Lösungen an: mehr Bewusstsein, bewusste Klärung, Akzeptanz des gegenwärtigen Augenblicks, in dem Kraft liegt, falls man die Konditionierungen des Denkens und Tuns fallen lässt.""Wherever you are, be there totally!"" Nicht verschieben auf einen späteren Zeitpunkt, sondern jetzt zu leben und nicht mit augenblicklichen Gefühlen oder üblichen Konditionierungen im Wartestand auf bessere Zeiten immer weiterzumachen, sondern dankbar zu werden gegenüber dem Leben, wie es ist, so die Botschaft.Wie unterscheidet Tolle sich von anderen Autoren, die das Gleiche sagen, anregen und lehren? Er beantwortet Fragen, die gestellt werden und die keinen Aspekt offen lassen; alle Skepsis, aller ""Unglaube"" wird in den Fragen geäußert und ""ehrliche"" Antworten darauf gegeben.Was ist PRÄSENZ? eine der vielfältigen Antworten ist: ...You cant understand presence only by thinking about it...Understanding presence is being present."" Tolle beschreibt ebenso den ""inneren Körper"" etc. und ein Kapitel über ""Beyond happiness and unhappiness"".Weiß man nicht allzuviel über derlei Thesen und hat nicht viel Kenntnis über die Strukturen  von consciousness, mind, Ego, pain und thinking, ist dies ein sehr klärendes und klares Werk, sehr zu empfehlen.

  As a nonduality devotee of authors like Richard Sylvester or Lisa Cairns, I refuse the expression of reaching enlightment by following a certain pathway or method, like ""staying completely in the now"". This would only emphazise the illusion that ""being here but wanting to be there"" would require walking down a certain route until an imaginary goal is reached. But what I really like about Tolles book are his statements on religion (especially in his other publication called a new earth), his explanation of mind insanity and his comments on the formless versus the manifested. It is definitely a great read and I would recommend it to anyone moving through the spiritual world. it will create waves in your soul :)

  I was recommended this book by a friend, and when i began i couldn't put it down.  The overall message is one of reaching an ultimate state of peace and happiness through the control of your thoughts and actions- bringing them into the 'Now'.  The changes to your life are small but have big impacts.  This is a book encompassing all of Ekhart Tolle's main principles, which however do become a bit repetitive throughout the book.  This is a must read for those people looking to grow spiritually to a happier 'Self'.

  I read this book years ago, and it still holds true, that the key to life is to stay in the now. It’s not easy to do sometimes, but trying to savour every moment helps. It’s about being mindful, to feel what you’re experiencing at this very moment. Just try it, even when you’re eating or drinking a beverage, savour the moment and be present for your life. Eckart teaches you how to do that.

  In meinem Bekannten- und Freundeskreis haben schon viele das Buch gelesen und so wurde ich neugierig. Generell stehe ich Menschen, die ""Erleuchtung"" versprechen, recht kritisch gegenüber. Das Buch ist in einem leicht verständlichen Englisch geschrieben und in kurze Abschnitte unterteilt, durch ein Pause- Zeichen wird einem auch an manchen Stellen zum Innehalten und ""Verdauen"" des Gelesenen geraten. Der Aufbau an sich scheint mir recht sinnig und gut.Der Inhalt dürfte für  ganz viele Menschen große Schwierigkeiten mit sich bringen. Es benötigt meiner Meinung nach einer bereits vorhandenen Offenheit und den Willen zur Selbstreflektion und die Fähigkeit unvoreingenommer Annahme/Betrachtung, um sich sinnvoll mit dem Buch auseinandersetzen zu können. Es dürfte eine große Zahl von Menschen geben, die den Inhalt falsch interpretieren und sich vor den Kopf gestoßen fühlen würden.Persönlich enthält das Buch für mich nicht mehr viel neues, vermutlich auch, da ich einen Großteil von Tolles ""Lehren"" durch meine Freunde bereits kenne. Manche Ansätze sind jedoch auch überraschend, regen zum Nachdenken an und enthalten viel Wahres und Nützliches. Nicht mit allem gehe ich konform, dennoch kann ich das Buch denjenigen empfehlen, die sich mit der Thematik auseinandersetzen möchten. Tolle verspricht meiner Meinung nach ein wenig viel, aber darüber kann man auch lächelnd hinwegsehen.Daher 4 Sterne für ein alles in allem gelungenen Buch.

  For me the first couple of chapters hold the most important points within the text and these give you some kind of clarity and reasoning should you be in a similar situation - i.e. being controlled by thought patterns.I can't help but feel the rest is too spiritual and the author tends to go on lengthy tangents that I struggled to get to grips with.The main idea behind the book though is plausible.  For that alone it's worth a shot.

  I used to be a raging alcoholic. In my recovery I found that the past was haunting me. Everywhere I went locally and people that I saw always brought back terrible memories of my behavior. This book changed my life and the way I viewed it. Letting go of the past and seeing that it is not helpful, was in fact extremely helpful to me. This book will teach every single person who reads it something precious. If I could click on 20 stars for my review I wouldn't hesitate : ) Stay Mindful folks and ENJOY!!

  Insgesamt ein sehr interessantes Buch, welches mir neue Denkweisen eröffnet hat. Und das obwohl ich dachte ich hätte schon viel zum Thema Self-Improvement gelernt.An manchen Stellen musste ich etwas mit den Augen rollen, weil ich diese ""blöd"" formuliert fand bzw. dachte wie kannst du das wissen.Doch gleichzeitig wurde mir während des Lesens bewusst, dass es keinen Sinn macht, sich gegen die Aussagen zu stemmen, nur weil manche der Wörter einem irgendwie nicht zusagen. Auf diese Weise würde mir nur das wertvolle Wissen hinter den Wörtern verloren gehen. Man muss tiefer blicken und verstehen, was Tolle eigentlich vermitteln möchte. Das sagt er ja am Anfang selbst, ""don't hold on to some of these words too much"" (oder so ähnlich).

  Overally I enjoyed reading it for the good points he makes. But, the writersounds  too delusional about Ibrahimic religions (Christianity in particular) and brings a lot of direct questions from them implying that he is promoting them. ""Enlightened"" as is described in the book is not anything but the actual human beings (Homosepiens), and not a realistic mentor in the real life. Peception of time is exactly what made apes become humans for the good or for the bad. Humanity has been a disaster to Earth as a complex yet homogeneous habitat for all the species up to the era when Homosepiens exploded in numbers and spread around. I can only recommend this book for learning the concept of 'living in the moment' by individuals when the humans craziness overwhelms them on daily basis and need to retreat. But, nothing for a physiological answer to the self destructive path taken by humanity.

  Found it quite hard to read (also have English as my 2nd language - although I was fluent at English since I was 12 (19 now)) Very thought-provoking ideas that I never thought about before.- Changes your perception of reality and your thought. Well worth the read. Although it is quite short, the pages are long and take time to read - having to take time to reflect and think about the ideas.- Some of the examples are not relevant to me at the moment, but of course one can easily skip past those.Well-written and I like the way it was written for someone who is totally new to the authors ideas.

  First, I am not English mother tounge, so, please do not put attention to my grammars' errors.I love the idea of the power of Now.Without doubts in the book the reader can find some good tips.Neverthless the way to explain is a little bit boring, very few examples, some points I do not understand how to put in practise, and so many times is talking about 'being' and others words for me without meanings.If you have a look to the author's web site, you see his big face on the home page.I do not understand why he blames the ego and then instead of putting a beautiful picture of creation in the home page he choosed to put his big face showing the ego inside him. I do not think he is a good teacher, but his filosophy is good so why three stars, you can read the book, but maybe it is better to find others authors explain the same idea, much better than him.

C'est notre mental, avec son flot presque continu de pensées, qui se soucie du passé et s'inquiète de l'avenir qu'il faut apprendre à maîtriser.

I also got Tolle's New Earth. Both books are immesurably helpful. Tolle says somewhere, that such consciousnessa is spreading among humankind. I hope he is right. Not only do I benefit from the insight Tolle has given me, but the people I live with have one less problem to live with because I don't get worked up about every little thing.

  Einfach ein grandioses Buch! Ich lese es jetzt schon zum zweiten Mal und es begeistert mich immer wieder. Die Thematik ist simpel und komplex zugleich, so dass man die Informationen zwischendurch gerne mal ein bisschen sacken lässt um alles zu verinnerlichen. Vom ""spirituellen Einsteiger"" über den ""Fortgeschrittenen"" bis hin zum ""Normalo"" ist das Buch für jeden geeignet. Ich würde es jedem ans Herz legen ""The Power of Now"" zu lesen, da es euer Leben in allen Lagen bereichern wird. Man muss natürlich offen sein für die Thematik und sich drauf einlassen. Besonders mag ich den Fragen und Antwort Stil in dem das Buch gehalten ist. Eckhart Tolle findet sehr tiefsinnige Antworten und formuliert sie in einer einfachen, verständlichen Sprache so dass die Botschaft für jedermann verständlich wird. Eine große Empfehlung!

  This is a book that can change your life.  I am reading it for a second time and each sentence seems to speak to me in a most powerful way. The whole concept of living in the now is so liberating. I was having problems with anxiety until I read Tolle's book and  I am finding that this teaching has given me a new approach to living. It is the best book on spiritual living I have ever read. I was a practicing Christian for 35 years  and I slowly got disillusioned by it. Tolle's teaching seems to have opened the door to a new way of understanding life and spirituality. You have to read it to understand. If you are searching for spiritual truth I would recommend reading  ""The Power of Now"" and also Stillness Speaks by Tolle.

  Wow, what an amazing book. As you read this book you sense and understand its message deeply. I think you will get the most out of ""The Power of Now"" if you are open and ready for it. As the author writes in the introduction, he speaks to your soul, and I think that this is why I found it so effective.As I read the book I could clearly feel many preconceptions I had melting away and my awareness growing page after page. It is a spiritual book but also a book about human psychology. Everything I read ringed true and I was able to implement what I read instantly in day-to-day life. I could not only understand myself but also others better. While I have been slowly ridding myself of emotional baggage and preconceptions over the last couple of years, I feel that this book helped me progress much faster. I first read it two months ago, and since then I have noticed that much of the remaining fear and unease I was still feeling gradually being displaced by an increasing sense of lightness and ease. I can identify arising negativity more quickly now and stop it before it progresses which helps keep anger and sadness at bay. And not being a slave of your thoughts and emotions is truly freeing. Together with regular meditation and practice of awareness, this book is changing my life for the better! :)I think that ""The Power of Now"" would be useful to anyone who wants to understand and improve themselves. I wish that it were required reading in school and hope that one day schools form a curriculum to educate children how to make the world a better place. I am now getting this book for family and friends... I feel like they should know about the book and hope that they read it soon!

  Dieses Buch ist für jene gedacht die verstehen wollen. Es ist keine Lektüre Die man nur einmal liest.  Man nimmt sie oft in verschiedenen Situationen in die Hand um sich erneut bewusst zu werden wer man ist und was wichtig ist beziehungsweise auch nicht. Beim Lesen hört man sich selbst zu. Es ermöglicht  - wenn man es zulässt - den Zugang zu absoluter Ruhe und warem Frieden. Sehr hilfreich sind hierbei die beschriebenen „Techniken“. Die Einfachheit diese Wahrheit erreicht Menschen jedoch denke ich nur wenn man den Worten mit ehrlichem Herzen lauscht...man muss es nicht verstehen....mit dem Verstand...und sollte keine Furcht haben vor grossen Veränderungen...Viel Spaß dabei...

  I can only return to this book sporadically due to lifestyle constraints, so it will be a very slow read, but maybe it's better that way in order to fully absorb and relate the wisdom herein contained.So far it's been rather mind-blowing, in that it appears to be a rational and concise synthesis of most of my personal psychological researches of the past 50 years, from Maslow in the 60's, followed by a long interest in Eastern belief systems, and many alternate psychological viewpoints including, amongst others, the ""channelings"" of SETH via Jane Roberts. All, while never providing ""The Answer"", adding to my overt and subconscious understanding of ""Life, The Universe, and Everything"".Now in these later days I've been trying to understand whatever relationships may exist between Reality, Thought, and Consciousness,  using the scence of Quantum Physics as a connecting link. Innately I feel that the scope of this research now extends way beyond any spiritual and metaphysical yearnings that have for aeons been the province of Religion, which has used our needs as a tool of  mis-information and social control.This amazing book appears to be doing it for me, and I believe that any person approaching this book with an open mind, and an ability to release the PC bonds of the so-called ""New Age"" Religion Replacement Paradigm, will greatly benefit from these perceptive words of wisdom, which aren't limited by any pre-determined paradigm. Wherever you're coming from, or going to, on whichever road, then this book is surely the most wonderful Travel Guide to yourself.I hope to post a fuller review on completion, if ever . . .

  The power of Now is a simple but effective guide to living a spiritually enriched life. Eckhart has just managed to clarify half a century of confusion for me. I spent my childhood attending church ....but not really getting it. I also attended school and didn't get that either. I then enjoyed a hedonistic adolescence, followed by the realities of marriage, parenthood and 'grandparenthood' and did get that, because relationships kind of demand our attention! I found myself struggling at times, so over the past decade educated my mind (as a mature student) and then my soul through many self help books and different religious texts, as well as studying psychotherapy.This insightful book is just what I had been searching for all these years. The question and answer style worked particularly well for me and I feel a real sense of relief because I can now  stop buying self help books ;-)Namaste Eckhart Tolle you are a beautiful soul who has given me a real feeling of peace  x

  I gave this book 5 stars out of 5 because I feel that's what it deserves. You don't really have to be religious, spiritual or anything to realise any truth in it.Nothing's perfect so I wouldn't say this book is 100% free of flaws, but most of it resonated for me and made me realise that I have created my own problems in life. It's not a case of saying yeah that was me and that was other people, and I don't care. More so it made me realise it's simply just egos colliding and reacting to each other, any friction at all. If someone murdered me tomorrow it would be their ego that done it. It would simply be, why get all egotistical and wound up about something that hasn't happened? That kind of attitude.If you're here deciding whether to buy it or not, search of some free Eckhart Tolle videos online, watch them, if it resonates with you consider buying this book. Don't bother just reading a review and taking any positive or negative review to make your mind. Watch a free video for yourself. Or get the ebook, thats free, simply google it.

  This book is truly amazing and changed my life. The secret of happiness is not money, relationships, job, car, and so on, but is simply the ability to focus on the now. The real prowess of this book is to summarize all the meditation, eastern philosophy, yoga and so on into the simple concept of focusing on the now. This is the secret of enjoying life at every moment. And that's all you need to know. It is not so easy to implement though and requires some training. Focusing on the future or on the past can be useful in some situations, but most of the time it does not serve us in any way, and makes us unhappy.

  This book changed my life forever. Stuck in a major depression since I was a teenager, at 40 years old I finally found a way out of the darkness after reading this book. 6 years later I am still referring back to this book and using the tools I learned in it. Each time I go back and read it I notice something new within the pages. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with questions about why we are here on this Earth. He doesn't tell you how it is for everyone, he guides you to get in touch with your inner knowing and to feel deep within your core how it is for YOU.

This one was one of the better ones I've read on the subject!I like how this book is a reminder to stay focused and present- it's the kind of book I would keep, and re-read every time I need a reminder of how to live life more in the present, enjoying every moment, and understanding how it doesn't matter how many plans I make for the future- it's how I am making these plans happen right now, in the present, that matters- that's what I took away from it.Book condition was good and delivery was fast, thank you!

  It's the book that's had the most powerful impact on my life so far. Makes you live life more humanly. Makes you more connected to your body, soul, and life.

  This book has completely changed the way I look at life. I have been battling severe anxiety my whole adult life. About 3/4 of the way through this book I had an aha moment where it all just made sense. After practicing what Tolle teaches for several weeks I can now say that I am 100% more aware of my thoughts and emotions. I can accept them without judgement or resistance and decide whether they really affect the present moment. I have never felt so at peace in all my life. Tolle quotes Jesus, Buddha and other spiritual visionaries throughout this book. I've never bought into organized religion but I now consider myself a spiritual person and I have a newfound respect for the enlightened masters who shaped modern religion.

  Ultimate Reality is One. Not two or three. Not a billion or a trillion. Just One. Everything springs from that One Reality. Nothing is outside of it. Suffering is caused by the illusion of having a self that is separate from all that Is. In fact, there is no personal ""me"". All personal identities are fictional. There is only one all-inclusive Impersonal Life. Subconsciously we all know this. Some people remember it and consciously experience the deep bliss of being.This book will start you on the path of remembering how great you truly are. This remembering will spring forth by itself as you drop your identification with all that which you thought you were but in fact are not (body, feelings, thoughts, concepts, etc). This book is written by a man who has done just that.

  While Tolle attempts to guide us down the path towards enlightenment through entering into the now, he breezes over some topics while spending too much time on other, less important topics. Science is not strongly debated in this book. However, if you're looking for the science behind enlightenment, presence of mind, meditation, it exists in plenty elsewhere. This book can help get you there through simple explanations of why the only place to focus on is the ""now.""Tolle, and frankly others of his kind, will always lack the words the describe what it truly means and how it feels to be present; and they will probably tell you that themselves. Nevertheless, those searching for more direction can probably find help with this book.

  Open your mind and read this. Take your time and come back to it often. Some of the concepts are questionable and tough to understand. Such is life. Eckhart does a very good job of taking obtuse concepts and explaining them in an understandable way. Slowing down and being at peace with yourself seems to be a worthy objective not to mention a good first step to being well connected to others.

  Ich war am Anfang skeptisch da Herr Tolle sich doch schon einiger Religionen bedient und ich eigentlich nach einem neutralem Buch in dieser Richtung suchte, aber man merkt schnell, dass er dies nur zur Veranschaulichung macht und die Prinzipien im Buch wirklich für jeden anwendbar sind. Viel möchte ich gar nicht mehr dazu sagen, aber jeder sollte wenigstens versuchen dieses Buch zu lesen und es in seinem Leben anzuwenden. Meiner Meinung nach kein Hokus Pokus, man kann es auslegen wie man will, wenn es in der persönlichen Praxis funktioniert ist es das wenige Geld wert und das hat es bei mir!

  The most wonderful thing about this book is its power to shift you into the 'Now"" even as you are reading it.  Tolle has examined what it means to be in the 'Npw"" with various situations and examples and how it feels when you are there. It is a spiritual aspirant's guide for growth, I liked the power of his language, at the same time the simplicity with which he has addressed  what seems like a profound concept to explain. This book is a must for spiritual seekers, coaches and anyone struggling to understand happiness.

  The Power of Now: A guide to spiritual enlightenment, by Eckhart Tolle, New World Library, USA, 1999; Hodder and Stoughton, UK, 2001; 224 ff.The Buddhist Way to inner peaceBy Howard A. JonesTolle has grown up from an unhappy, potentially suicidal childhood to write an inspiring text on the search for peace and contentment through spiritual enlightenment. Born Ulrich Tolle in Germany he changed his name from his admiration for the writings of the German mystic, Meister Eckhart. Self taught from the age of 13 he nevertheless graduated from both the University of London and Cambridge University. This book is essentially an approachable and non-religious distillation of the core teachings of Buddhism.The book is written as a dialogue between the author and an imaginary sceptical inquisitor. The quest is a search for release from the pain-body as Eckhart calls it, which has elements of Jung's shadow about it but is probably closest to the Buddhist notion of ""dukkha"" - unease, discontent or disquiet, the continual search for something more and better. Eckhart is encouraging us to `leave mind and find consciousness', to set aside `the delusion of time' for `nothing exists outside the now'. Or, as a wise mystic told me, `The past is gone - it cannot be changed or rewritten. The future is only a series of wishes and dreams - or fears, of consequences of past misdeeds. The present is the only place to be.'  To quote Eckhart again: `The power of Now is your consciousness liberated from thought forms'. It is about `Finding your invisible and indestructible reality' in order to slow down the aging process, strengthen the immune system and encourage enlightened relationships. The setting aside of the ego is something many spiritual disciplines encourage.Whether you are already on a spiritual quest or are seeking the key to open one, this is a worthwhile read. My only serious criticism would be that it is rather repetitive. The essential message could have been presented in just a few pages: but then, a message that is so alien to the kind of life that most of us lead needs to be repeated in many different ways.Dr Howard A. Jones is the author of The Thoughtful Guide to God (2006) and The Tao of Holism (2008), both published by O Books of Winchester, U.K.

This will rapidly deepen and transform your life"".私にとってはこの一節が全てであり、これ以上は不要であると思います。

  Well I read the whole book, but I haven't learnt much from it. It kept referring to religions in ways such as quoting the bible or speaking about Buddha, which is fine if you're religious, but gets quite boring after a while if you're an atheist. It's generally easy to read, but I personally disliked the way the author would ask questions, as if the reader was asking them, and would then go on to argue with him self about these questions. Whole pages would be spent on the author having an argument with him self over trivial things the reader probably wouldn't have asked in the first place. I know this book has helped many people so I wouldn't like to say it is a bad book, but I personally did not gain anything from reading it and for that reason I give it 2 stars.

  can't add anything to the things other people have already said. If you are a searcher or a seeker you need this book in your life, Definitely a big part of my own jigsaw puzzle, it would particularly benefit anyone who has read any books on buddhism, as an existing awareness of meditative practices or true mindfullness and being in the moment would link you into this fairly smoothly, it could be a bit frustrating coming to this book cold.I also own the audio version of this and I found it better than the book, much easier to listen to and played it very often. There are some more esoteric ideas in here than just the central tenet of being in the now and I found myslef quite drawn to some of the writings on time and space but there is a choice for the reader in those terms as to where you see your priotiies. Its a brilliant work and in essence so very simple, almost zen like, but as with all things spiritual perhaps difficult to adapt into a 21st century lifestyle for some, however it is written in such a style that it is easier to see oneself adopting these ideas into ones life on a day to day basis as Eckhart has already done so himself. Maybe for some people this is an end to itself, for me its definitely a big part of my journey and has helped significantly in helping me adapt a spiritual life mainly grounded in buddhist practices more coherently into every day modern life. Get it you won't regret it.

  I've always been very skeptical of 'self-help' books, but after a somewhat stressful period in my life, this book provided a much needed clear perspective of things.I have previously bought a digital copy that I read on my iPad but bought this copy to take on holiday.It's easy to fall into cycles of unhappiness with work, your environment, your relationships etc and often when we are in 'that' place, it's hard to realise.About 2 years ago, I was stuck in a rut with work, hated the area where I lived (very noisy, lots of crime etc and overpopulated) and struggled to see the positive in life or a way forward. It put a strain on my relationship as I wa always moaning about something to my partner.This book helped me break out of a cycle that was keeping me unhappy and see that stress, anxiety and unhappiness are all under your control and you can choose to either stay in a cycle of negativity or become a happier, better version of yourself.I still re-read the book on occasion as a 'top-up' to make sure I don't fall into my old ways which helps a lot.The writing style of Eckart Tolle is easy to read, clear and although on occasions this book can be a little repetitive, it's casual enough to be easily engrossing.I challenge anyone who finds themselves in a rut to read this book and keep an open mind - it will not disappoint!

  I found this book rather compelling in it's guide to spiritual enlightenment. I think within it there are some really interesting and thought provoking ideas that can be used to achieve real progress within your spiritual development. That said though I felt a lot of what was written was difficult to take in with the way in which it was put across. This could mean parts were hard to read and could be quite boring. I felt sometimes that a lot of the points could perhaps have been put across with more clarity and at parts I felt the same point was conveyed many times in a long winded way which again made parts boring. That said some of the insight within this book was fascinating and I have used some of the approaches myself and find that some of it could allow for a major advance in obtaining spiritual enlightenment. I recommend for people to read this book and take some of the little gems from it without losing yourself in the over contrived and at times somewhat lengthy narrative. Used in addition to your other spiritual reading, knowledge and intuition it certainly is an extremely handy tool that offers a different perspective and approach to achieving your own spiritual enlightenment.

  I've been meditating for many years now and, on Sunday of last week, my girlfriend lent me this book. I envisaged it being a protracted/scientific/borderline read similar to the David Icke genre, however, it's not and I finished it this morning.Very simple, very real, very me.An excellent read for anyone on a spiritual path regardless of your religion. For example, yesterday, I spoke to 2 Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs), one of whom was an Elder, who were visiting my mum, who is also a JW, and they couldn't fault anything that I was saying. ""Now"" turned the conversation from most of the bible (past) to the Revelation (future) into a conversation in-Now about-Now. Awesome!

  This is not a book to rush through.  It was recommended by a friend who found it did all sorts of good things for him.  It is not the latest, but timeless.I am still trying to come to grips with what it says.  There are those for whom it will be a revelation, I am sure, but I have a sense of 'deja vu' because of a lifetime of reading in that sort of genre.  What it has to say, so far, seems to be good  sense.I will give more of an opinion when I have gone further.

  I am of Christian faith and while having had a personal experience with that I had, to an extent been 'switched off' from the living reality of this. For many years I had been increasingly finding it hard to relate to and resonate with me personally. Eckhart would attribute this to an unconscious domination of the ego (synonymous with sin). This book has unlocked my faith once more in a transforming and wonderful way.A truly prophetic and special author who is able to reach any faith or higher power belief. I must add however that while this philosophy can be effective for anybody, I personally would find it somewhat empty and lacking without an underlying Christian faith. If you have been recommended this book or have discovered it any which other way then you may well be ready for it to work for you in a way that is truly unique and personal to you.Enjoy the journey and allow it to unlock the treasure, the mysteries of your inner eternity.

  If I had read this book 25 years ago, I would have struggled to really grasp what it talks about.  That has nothing to do with getting older.  What is relevant is that it fully describes a state of enlightenment that I went through nearly 20 years ago.At that time however I did not mentally understand it or even want to try.  Everything was totally perfect just the way it was.Tolle mentions somewhere else, maybe on You Tube that The Now cannot be desribed mentally, because it is beyond the mind.  And it would be like trying to explain to someone who has never eaten honey, what it really tastes like.  Volumes could be written and illustrated with explanations and beautiful pictures of bees and flowers and hives.  But until that person actually tasted honey, it would be futile.During my enlightened phase, or pure Presence, all my mental ramblings were no longer there, that was perhaps the most significant thing.  Pure peace and listening to music as though I'd never heard it before, full of awe. Completely at ease yet totally alert and aware of everything as if with new eyes and ears. AND without identifying with things.  I remember it dawning on me with great impact, ""Wow, how come I've lived all my life like I have (In the Mind) and this is how it is really meant to be.I will add, for skeptics that I was not under the influence of any illegal substances, nor ever have been.These days however, whenever if sit in the garden in summer, I'll be thinking ""That Lavender needs trimming back, or I  must cut the lawn, and then the hedge needs cutting.""  Whilst the guy next door, has garden knee high in weeds and he's dozing in his deck chair.  Neither of us are ""Present"".Being present, I would be fully alert and very relaxed and see the plants and lawn, but would not be identifying it mentally and would just ""feel"" pure ""joy"" and a oneness with everything, timeless, no thoughts.  Of course when I ""Need"" to think about something, like preparing lunch I can, BUT my mind will not keep running off in all different directions thinking, ""Oh yes, that ham was a good price from Asda and I met Fred Smith in there who was telling me about their Janice who went to the dentist last week and had a root canal.  When's my dental appt due.  By, that dentist I go to has got a real good car now..........""  I would be fully focused on what I need to do to prepare lunch and giving it my full attention.Perhaps the closest I had ever been to being Present, or in The Now , were rare times and even from childhood, (because kids are naturally more present} and very transitory too,was when I was stood in the middle of a woods and just listening and watching a babbling brook in a stream, and feeling completely peaceful and grounded and totally content.  Pure consciosness, but within a few seconds... gone.20 years ago, that state stayed with me for several weeks!  And another very poignant thing is that I had this secure, grounded contentment that was not affected by anything externally.  In other words, I would act upon things that needed it but did not ""react"".If driving and someone cut across my bows, I would act by applying the brakes but felt no anger or upset in the least.  I am naturally quite patient and in instances where this does happen, I have learnt to be tolerant, and accept what is without reacting, but even with my patience, it still disturbs my equilibrium slightly. But I know mentally that it's my ego that's been bruised.  HOW DARE you cut in front of ME!That is all on the mental level and understood on the mental level.BUT If I were totally in the NOW, as Tolle explains, and although I would be realistically aware and alert of the danger, my equilibrium would be undisturbed, and I would still retain the alert inner joy and acceptance of WHAT IS.  Tolle is in this state permanently and is totally non egotistic.Why do I need to sit on this laptop and write this.  Basically it's my ego.  Look at me, read what I say, my life and my story, and whilst I type these wodrds I'm on a little bit of a buzz from it, but then it's just another quick fix.  I could get a real spin and use Facebook much more and get addicted.  The Mind is in the driving seat far too much aided by modern technology.I try not to get frustrated at not being able to ""get back"" to what I found 20 years ago, and I've tried and tried, and know it's all still within, and remembering what that was like because I've ""experienced it!""  And I know mentally that all the searching and reading is futile.  As Tolle says, we digest food but we don't need to understand the digestion process.I could go on and on...I do sincerely hope that what I have written helps someone, and give it purpose.I have read many books before this and many since in my quest but nothing at all compares with THE POWER of NOW.  The other books are good too but it is all the fundementals are all here.(Tolles interpretations of The Parables in the bible make sense to me.  However, he says that Christ was just another great spiritual teacher like the others.  But, Jesus claimed in many places, that he was the son of God.  No other spiritual teacher ever claimed to be such. !!! ?)I

  This book helped change my mindset and my life. I read this just before being diagnosed with cancer and going through chemoradation therapy in the summer of 2013. I'm so grateful to Eckhart Tolle for this book, it put everything into perspective and made a difficult time in my life a calm enlightening experience taken minute to minute day by day.I can understand how this book is not for everyone and the religious references are lost on me as I do not belief in God or gods, but can see why these are referenced as many people still do. All in I would recommend this book to most people and it has opened my eyes to reading some other great books which I never would have considered before the Power of Now. A great reading experience.

  Yea I have read a lot of books in my 74 years, few satisfy, fewer yet are helpful to understand the mystery of life, why I am here, why it seems my manifestations do not correspond to what I wish I were, why it seems there is more suffering in life than is needed really???  And many questions with no name. But this book is a whole level different. It is useful, it clear, and if read carefully (read  paragraph, pause and ask, is this true, now, for me? and let the question sink in and a true response appear) has an affect on my life that is apparent and perceptible to the sensation and feeling of myself. For me, it is required reading to live a human life, in the good sense of human. Read it, try it on, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

  An astonishing work; wonderful.  Its like taking a mental shower.  Written plainly and simply, it nevertheless is the most profound and meaningful book I have ever read. From reading the first few pages, it all made complete sense and it changed my whole outlook on life.  I have been interested in personal development, meditation, cutting edge physics and metaphysics for some years now, and more recently in spirituality, and this book has answered many nagging questions. I would recommend it to anybody and everybody. I cannot praise it enough.

  This is a truly inspiring book that I would recommend to everyone, no matter what faith you have or indeed no faith at all. It was recommended to me by a friend and I ordered it after starting practice at mindful meditation, aimed at calming down my over active mind. Tolle is right about how living in the now is the key to a more peaceful and happy life and it's interesting how he ties this message in with faith - with Buddhism was understandable, but also with Christianity. Very interesting take on how some of the scriptures can be interpreted. I have found that this book, along with a simple guide to Buddhism, have changed the way I live my life for the better and I have no hesitation in saying that I am calmer, happier and better to live with. Do try it.

  A totally life changing book.  Not the easiest read you'll ever experience - you need to concentrate and re-read a few bits (or at least I did), but it really has given me a completely new way of looking at my life and within two days of starting the book, I really found a difference in my awareness of my ""now"" along with a much quieter mind.  Two weeks later, I am reading A New Earth and those closest to me have noticed a real change in my level of happiness and I myself feel a great deal more peace and less pressure than I ever have before.

  Awesome little tome that could change your life, that is how I would sum this book up. A five star read for those interested in enlightenment, living a happier life or learning to subjugate their egos.The Author illustrates how living in the present moment- THE NOW, can benefit you in life and allow you create a better sense of harmony and purpose, the teachings are quite profound  and similar to buddhist thought, however the author is very good at explaining these sometimes intractable concepts so that you can relate to them more easily and bring them into your day-to-day life experiences. The book is related to the concept of destroying/learning to control your ego/ego death and without trying to explain the whole book in one fell swoop, it is safe to say that  the Eckhart Tolle has a lot of wisdom to impart on this aspect of self existence.The one criticism I have, but it is not a serious one, is that the author could have used a shorter book to impart the same amount of wisdom, however for ""newbies"" it might be a bit overwhelming to rush it and I guess a lot of people will relate better to a more relaxing pace of learning this crucial piece of life knowledge.

  Eckhart Tolle has produced a book that (a) constantly reminds us that this moment is the one we should be dealing with - yesterday has gone, tomorrow may have all sorts of unpredictable events, and (b) proposes that the individual's quiet inner being is the link to ""God"", however we conceive him.  He quotes from many religions to support this, and guides the reader to distinguish between the learned concepts and reactions that create so much mental ""noise"" as we try to understand, control and direct life.  The result is a guide to enjoying life more by putting our emotional energy into dealing with what is, rather than what we think may be, or fear is.  This is a book that can be referred to often, and is unlike other spiritual guidance books in that it acknowledges the individual journey, and does not try to promote a ""one size fits all"" menu for change.

  Amazing book, a real revelation for me.It really connected with me, and I have been on a long spiritual journey in my life.Eckhart seemed an unlikely source for me for this life changing revelation. But this book will change your life if you read and apply it in your life.This book has started a new spiritual journey for me.

  I have mixed feelings about this book. I’m retired, male and keen on personal development, especially focused on the mind. I dabble in a bit of meditation, I have a very positive outlook and I look after myself physically, though I could probably lose a few pounds in weight. When I saw this book on Amazon I decided to have a go at it. The reviews were pretty good and I love these sorts of books. However, I struggled with it for several reasons. I just felt it was a bit too “high handed” and I was being lectured to. I’m not keen on the question and answer format and there was nothing in there that made me close my eyes and sit back, thinking “That’s absolutely right. The words are perfect”. The book didn’t “capture me”. I’ve just finished a book on the Dalai Lama and another on breathing exercises, both of which were enlightening and a joy to read. I’ve also gone through “Conversations with God” by Walsch (all books) and several others on mindfulness and self development, so I’m surprised I found this so difficult. I recognise that thousands of others have found it enlightening and love the book so I’m not going to bad-mouth it. It just didn’t do it for me, but it might do it for you!

  I have read this book about three times now, I keep it under the bed and read a section when the moment takes me. You do not have to be religious to get on board with it, and Tolle makes that clear, and yes it is a lot of Buddhist theory, but it is all still relevant. A lot of the negative feedback comments I felt must have been from speed readers who did not understand or think through the concepts, or as Tolle says are not ready to hear it.

  For anyone who finds themselves always thinking about tomorrows, or always thinking about their yesterdays - Eckhart Tolle encourages you to stop, take a moment, and recognise to the true value of the present moment.I enjoyed the read and also bought a copy of the audio-book version.  The audio version makes for a welcome listen on a long walk (or a lot of little short walks!)Eckhart speaks and reads in a very relaxed way.  He often makes long pauses - there were occasions when I thought I'd hit the pause button by mistake!  But Eckhart encourages you to hit your pause button, to take a moment and spend it in the here and now, and take a breather from worrying about what has happened in the past, or what might happen in your future.If you're looking to take an opportunity to stop and quieten your mind, then I recommend reading or listening to Eckhart Tolle.

I'll leave it a while and then launch in at chapter 1 rather than re-reading the intro.

  What can I say about this truly life changing book? It has completely changed the way I view my life. Everything Mr. Tolle talks about is 100% true because before I read this book, I was fearful, anxious, nervous and I kept having conversations in my mind imagining the worst case scenario's of future events which was making me constantly anxious. Mr. Tolle taught me to live in the ''now'' just 'being' Instead of living in my mind. The mind only thinks of the past and future (How true is this! That's all my mind thought about until I read this book). Since reading I am having the best sleep I've had in years, my mind feels at peace and I am now living in day tight compartments, living in the ''now''. I have now become the watchman of my mind! Please BUY THIS BOOK! It really will change your life and eliminate erroneous thinking forms. Thank you so much Mr. Tolle!

  I picked the book largely on the grounds of decent ratings score. That was my mistake you pay the money and you take your chances.I was slightly disappointed that a lot of the reading in the book has already been published previously by other author's. Philosophies with religious beliefs are its strengths, the rest is of the book comes from a mixture of Books, mostly in the interests of Buddhism.

  Eckhart Tolle gives some common sense advice in this very absorbing book.  So difficult though to follow all the rules he suggests of living only in the present moment- I must try harder.  How often does the mind wander off into the past or the possible future?  How true too are his suggestions that living in the past or stressing about the future are a big cause of mental illness? Reading this book really makes one aware of how much time we all waste worrying about what may never happen or on dwelling on unhappy events from the past.  My only criticism is that I am not keen on the books spiritual aspect, I really don't think this is necessary as even without spirituality he recommends a sensible way of life. My only problem NOW is that every time I buy a new copy of this book someone borrows it and I am POWERless to prevent it.  On the upside I've stopped worrying about them being returned, life is much too short!!

  Amazing .Seems to be a good manual re the everyday attempt to be in touch with that magical part of oneself which we all seek.So strange that we only need to be quiet for a bit , to be in touch with with it, before we are back again in our hurly burly lives.I am repeatedly taken aback at the astuteness of it; all cars have manuals; this is the manual for that challenge of being as much as possible in the focus of the present. That place where we really are who we are.Yes it is all a bit like Ground hog Day.And feels a bit what Buddhists are about. Well a whole lot what Buddhists are about.Like happiness, this comes as being highly recommended.The way I see it; I am like the driver in my car.

  I believe this book has been accused of ""mumbo jumbo"" and some of the writing feels that way.  However if you accept the author's terminology he has some very interesting ideas that many people may find helpful.  At times he seems to think his ideas are about to be (or need be) accepted by the whole world, or else we're in trouble.  This seems a bit over confident, but should not detract from his arguments if they seem relevant to you as an individual.  Overall I would recommend this book as thoughtful, insightful and potentially very useful to many people.

  You don't need to have a university degree or be ""extremely intelligent"" to understand this book. As Tolle said, words are just signpost, they have the purpose to point you in the right direction. Don't try to understand them with your mind. For the people who are not ready to receive this kind of teachings, this book will be completely useless. What Tolle says in the book is ALREADY INSIDE ALL OF US. He just brings it up. You will know what the truth is by yourself. As he said, the purpose of this book is not to add something to your knowledge, but to awaken your soul. The fact that you came across this book is already a sign that something inside you wants to come out. Please don't ignore it.

  I think everything has already been said about this book.  I think I gave my original copy away, hence I bought the Kindle edition.  So much of what he says about the 'unconscious' or 'unskillful' way people lead their lives in our modern world is doubtless true.  People are thinking short-term and selfishly and few are in any position to do anything about it.  The problem seems unsolvable.  But some like Eckhart Tolle, Thich Nhat Hanh and the Dalai Lama remain optimistic!  When we're not faced with disaster or serious trouble or desperate insecurity of some kind, the book seems to make perfect sense, but if we were to be, well I'm not so sure.  On a personal spiritual level, I think it's still a valuable book and refreshingly free from religious dogma.

  Having read the book for a third time it has again touched something deep inside me. I realise that the spiritual path is a lifelong path with many peaks and valleys along the way. The peaks being the highs of life (achievements etc) the valleys the lows (loss of materialistic things, partner etc) but on a deep level the path is always guiding you. We might come to a crossroads sign,turn the wrong way and go down a deep valley ending up at a dead end (we missed that sign)! The way back  is uphill,painful and a struggle,but worth it once we are back on the path. Having read this book again I realise it's more of an A-Z of life,much like the old A-Z road maps. We know the local paths but once we venture further out of town we can easily become lost. This book keeps you on the path or guides you back onto it. The more you read it the more the sign posts are there if you are conscious enough not to miss them. Enjoy :-) Dave Buxton.

  This book is fantastic! It was recommended to me by a friend and I must say it has really opened my eyes and has done a lot for my anxiety and depression.I must admit I am not a spiritual person in anyway shape or form but this book speaks bags of truth and I’ll be open and honest, if you buy this book, please keep an open mind. Don’t judge a word If it’s religious, religious or if it doesn’t tie into your beliefs. The author actually covers a number of religions and belief systems and it’s wonderful!That said, if you just look past the wording and really allow yourself to take in what the author is saying, you will be transformed. Basically I would say this book will only help those who are truest truly committed their personal empowerment.So yes, give it a go. What have you got to lose? Nothing, you will only gain.

  This is a book for anyone who is interested in establishing peace and happiness in their lives by going inside and feeling what is there as our birth-right. Personally I can relate to Eckhart because I had similar experiences as him and know that what he talks about is for real and not just another philosophy to chew over in your mind but a reality to be experienced. Just listening to the word is missing the point which is why some complain that he repeats himself - they just don't get what he's on about and exclude themselves from the experience through a lack of interest in finding something real inside. Read this one first before looking at his other books. 'A New Earth' is a really good book too which I read after this one and found it very helpful.

  This book really is life changing. It is quite hard to explain, but I think when you are absolutely ready you will read and understand this book. I very rarely write reviews and I certainly didn't believe in all this kind of stuff! But I'm so glad I found this book, I want all my family and friends to read this but most of them just simply think its rubbish!! If you have suffered with any kind of stress, anxiety, depression then you should read this book.As silly as this sounds I just didn't realise that there was a Now! I was ALWAYS on to the next thing and then I wondered why I was always stressed. Anyway give it a try, it makes life a much happier place. I'm very thankful to Eckhart Tolle for sharing this amazing book, and also look at his youtube videos these are very helpful too.

  Good book for anybody over the age of 30 who is slowly becoming interested in their inner self and the power of calmness and stillness.  Some interesting things the author says, and I believe it was a life changer for some people.I have reduced two stars because one I didn't like the frequent references to god (a self-help book should be religion free) and two I didn't like the bits where he talks about death.  That was too dark for me and didn't make any sense. It all sounded a bit like a brainwashed person talking.The rest was great, and a very good book to read.  I recommend. Yes. Go for it.

  This was recommended to me by my counsellor as I am a person in therapy and a student of counselling currently just completed ICSK-L2. Honestly the way Tolle extols his own virtues from the very first page made me nauseous and I couldn't finish it. When an author writes a book of any note, it is oft found that there will be an inspiring quote on the opening page from a great thinker or an associated expert. In this book, the quote is from Tolle himself, and this is a great example of how he clearly believes his is the only voice in the wilderness. In this case the wilderness is simply the place where we find anyone who doesn't think Eckhart Tolle is a genius. Drivel from a dreamer on an ego trip. I have launched this book across the room no less than three times before finally giving into the truth that it was written for people who are not, in short, me.

  I first read this book about 18 months ago and found it very profound. It contains so many things that you just (me anyway) know to be true and I realised that, on a certain level, I have always known these things.The book really needs to be read again and again but during a move last year it got lost and I have only just got around to replacing it. At the second reading it has affected me on an even deeper level and I am determined to try to live my life more in the present moment. I think that this should be compulsory reading for everyone.

  I enjoyed this book.  It's simplicity in delivering the profound was excellent and I have to say I agree with 99% of its content, as I already try to live my life by its direction.However, I do question some of Tolle's indefatigable argument against putting, future thought, to one side.  Is it so wrong, on making some future arrangement to say, `I'll look forward to it,' and meaning it ?  And, in the extreme... How many victims of the Holocaust or similar event, who, because they were unable to bring about change, accepted, the `Now,' perished, when those who projected their thoughts away from the indescribable inhumanity of their `Now,' to an improved future, survived ? It is called... `hope.'

  Best book I have ever read. It will literally change your life.  I found myself reading it and my view of the world was changing as I read it.  Cant recommend this enough.  You will read and look up from the book and the room will look different, more fresh and you will notice things you have never noticed before.  This book has a magical effect.. I would also recommend doing some of Eckhart Tolles guided meditations off youtube.. they literally made me see the world in a way I never had before, everything seemed so beautiful and nothing could bother me, there was only beauty all around.  Since reading this I have read a lot of other books on the same subject.  There is no need though, this is the only book that is needed.  I think the important thing about this book is that it does not tell you need anything other than you already have, so there is no conflict.  Only peace.

The book mentions things from religions, god, jesus, etc, but any conclusion you come up with in your head that this means that Eckhart Tolle is trying to make you become christian, is a christian, or is biased towards any religion, will purely be mentally constructed with no evidence of such.

  Heed the message, not the messenger. The premise is fair enough, but Eckhardt Tolle comes over as a sanctimonious know-it-all. The first thing he tells us is that one day he had a life-changing experience in which he whirled around in some sort of transcendental vortex. Not something a lot of us are going to get to experience, so we just have to make do with Eckhardt telling us that we're all a bit dumb for not being more like him. It took me all my belief in the power of Do It Right Now to keep ploughing through it.

  There is an awakening happening all over the world. Mine hit me like a freight train right between the eyes during Christmas 2010. Watching endless Youtube videos of people for whom the same had happened brought me to this book and the other works of Tolle.Let me put this simply. If you are ready and starting to wake up, this book will probably change your life. If you are still asleep or 'unconscience' as Tolle puts it, you will get nothing and think its a load of codswallop as one reviewer has written.

  In 1969 I read Be Here Now by Ram Dass........and so my spiritual journey began. I knew the answers to much of humanity's suffering was right in front of me. I was simply unable to translate it to my own life and make it work. Hundreds of books, millions of dollars, two divorces, several kinds of anti-depressants, and 45 years later I found Eckhart Tolle. The book itself is amazing and transformational. My life changing experience however did not come from insight gained in the text. The preface which gave a brief but clear account of Tolle's own transformation completely overwhelmed me. I was completely engulfed by my personal connection to the author's own pain and fear before his journey began. Reading it over and over and shedding many tears, I knew without any doubt that beginning that day I would start my own journey into the present. Make no mistake I was fearful. But who am I without thought, judgment, or control ? I would gladly trade my ego for peace. On 3-5-15 I began an absolute commitment to stay present and live in gratitude. I told myself I would give it 6 months and just watch the process unfold without judgement. Staying present over time changed the way I lived each moment. Insight and epiphanies came at me from everywhere and I was certain I was finally on my path. However, where the rubber meets the road for me was that small space before a thought that staying present gave me. That small space is everything. With it you can watch your thought instead of being your thought.....or perhaps not have that thought at all. Simply come present again and feel gratitude. Easier said than done perhaps, but we all have the power of now if we so choose it. Eckhert Tolle gave me the courage to choose it and live it.

  This book has really changed my outlook on life. I've your struggling with life or meditation and mindfulness thinking, Eckhart Tolle will demonstrate it in the most in-depth way. I find that some of his views especially on re-thinking emotions and feelings are a bit rational, but I took that part with a pinch of salt, no theory is perfect. Marianne Williamson's Return to love makes a good company for The power of now, as it's a bit more about having self-compassion and reviewing your emotions.

  One of the most important books I have ever read.  I believe this says what so many of the philosophers and religious figures down the ages have probably tried to express but never found the right words to say.  This book is about eliminating the illusion of time and concentrating on the moment. A very simple principal but one that is of profound importance to each person alive today that is searching for contentment, joy and peace of mind.  Buy it, read it, live it.

  Repetitive drivel. One or two sentences sort of explain the behavioural dynamics of relationships, but theres a huge amount of filler inbetween anything of use. The early techniques for meditation are useful and pleasant to try. Reading the book is very calming, I put that down to a lot of empty words.

  A good guide to spiritual awareness and awakening, although I did feel that some of the information a little repetitive at times. Being an internationally recognised spiritual teacher  Eckhart Tolle  has a very self-assured way of conveying his philosophy which appears to be inspired by the ""new-age"" school of thought.  The book is thought provoking and may or may not help you to find that elusive enlightened path. I could be in the minority for giving this publication 3 out of 5 stars, but as we're in the realms of subjective topic that relies to a degree on how we as individuals perceive life and the world around us, I can only speak for myself.

  Fully deserves 100 stars.This book is one of only 3-5 books in my life that have made such a massive impact into how I have managed to keep some semblance of peace in my life.The Power Of Now will (if you put its central message into practice) transform your life from barely concealed insanity (the majority of people, myself included) to someone established in a solid foundation of peace, contentment and focus.This is going to sound hyperbolic, but I would say this book needs to be read and lived by every human on earth - it is the evolution our species has been waiting for - mark these words.Eckhart Tolle was called by Oprah Winfrey ""a prophet"" and I agree.  Buy this book, become your true self, you won't regret it.Wow that went on a bit, I could go on, no I'll stop there but to say;Recommended to anyone who wants peace of mind and who is ready for practical and real truths about how we LIVE / BE, in a ""nutshell"".

  An amazing book. Negative reviews will have been written by those who don't want to accept the teachings or who are unwilling to read the style of writing. Some of the later chapters become very spiritually focused so even I found it a little much to embrace his messages without thinking he was ""preaching"" or being a little ""woo woo"". But after the first 5 chapters you're already happy if you can apply what he says.

  This book is not for the faint heart-ed. It takes some reading, you may find, like me, you have to keep going over a chapter before things start to sink in. Not for everyone, it does get you thinking outside the box and I have found it very useful, especially when things in life start to get on top of  me. I revert back to a particular chapter an take a moment to reflect. For the more spiritual reader I think.

  If you're not open minded, this book probably isn't for you. A lot of the negative reviews you will see are by people that have either misunderstood the message or taken it far too literally. The teachings are similar to that of mindfulness meditation and are not something that will transform your life by just reading a book. It needs to be practised over time and with patience. My only criticism is that the wording is quite strong and direct and it almost makes you feel pressured into being 'present'  which completely goes against the grain of being in the moment as you end up feeling anxious about getting it right. Great book overall but take the guidance with a pinch of salt and leave your expectations at the door

  This book is a silent masterpiece amongst many 'how to' books on living.It challenges the age old dictum of Descartes - 'I think, therefore I am' very conclusively. To me, the salient and practical takeaways from this book are:1) The ability to eradicate thought through 'present moment awareness'2) The importance of a 'time independent' frame of mind, and action3) The beauty and fruitfulness of 'thinking through and with the body'4) The technique of seeing through negative emotions by acceptance, awareness and being 'transparent' to the feeling as it arises.The book has a very profound section on relationships, and a special piece of advice to women on how to liberate themselves during their physiological cycle.

  I agree with the overall message that mindfulness is the key to liberation from suffering. However, the writing feels quite narcissistic and uses terms/concepts that are never defined. For someone looking for a pragmatic guide to self-improvement through mindfulness, I would not recommend this book.There are so many better books out there that this book is a waste of time. I do not believe this book deserves the reviews it currently has but I guess that's due to Oprah's publicity.

  My cousin told me to read this book knowing that for the last couple years I've been dealing with so much stress, tragedies, unhappiness, I guess you could say my life felt hopeless. I've ready many self help books and sure you can learn a few things here and there, in general I found a lot of them a waste of time.  So my cousin, knowing what I've been dealing with and the challenges I am facing ahead of me, he told me about this book and a few of his others. He didn't have to do much convincing, after hearing how it changed his life, his sisters....I decided to check it out myself. After reading a lot of the reviews, which were all positive( which is rare when there are tons of reviews).  I purchased it on my kindle right away and even though I've only read 4 chapters, i am really enjoying it and I can't wait to continue and finish it. It's definitively an intense read, so you don't want to be rushing through it. It's good to read a little and then really think about what you've read and absorb it.

A very powerful work. For those in the spiritual community who are familar with Buddhism or are intrigued by it, if you are looking for someone who is truly and authentically enlightened; Eckhart Tolle is - completely.Buddhism has been saying this for years and Tolle says it with greater simplicity and impact - there is only this moment, the now, thats all there ever has been, thats all there ever will be.

  It was at the beginning of my spiritual journey (nearly 2 years ago) that I was recommended a couple of books by Eckhart Tolle and so rushed out to purchase The Power of Now and A New Earth.I struggled with both.I'm a simple person, neither were getting their message through to me.  So I put them away (with my many other half-read Self-Help books).About a month or so ago, I bought and read Brian Mayne's ""Self Mapping"" - WOW !  A fantastic explanation of the Ego and especially the low-self / Higher-Self and what types of 'thoughts' come from where.Don't ask me how, but about a week or so after finishing that book, I decided to re-attempt to read The Power of Now - it was staring at me on the Fireplace, inviting me to have another go.......Basically, this book is about the Power of Now (duh !) - not the past, not the future, not our unconscious chattering minds, but about Being Conscious, consciously aware and present, being enlightened and the power of all that (as opposed to the Ego and living in the memories of our past or fears in the future).I didn't have any real idea what this book was about but it pretty much confirms everything I think already - only Eckhart can explain in beautiful English what I cannot in own mother tongue !!He's a very clever man and I have loved reading this book.Basically I was now ready and am proof that when you are ready, the teacher appears (or re-appears in my case).Thank you Mr Tolle.Onwards and upwards !

  This is going to sound fantastical and also perhaps sacrilegious!  I feel Tolle and his teachings are on a par with past major philosophers that their followers transformed into religions. We're talking Bhudda, jesus, mohammed. The enlightenment offered is the same without the clutter of power seeking misguided followers. Tolle praises all these religions he offers not another group to join but an understanding of what we all as humans are. Read slowly and meditate on the ideas to gain full effect.

  Can't really give this a poor rating as I didn't reach very much of it.I was looking for a practical guide to mindfulness and found the introduction about the overnight conversion into 5 months of bliss a little far-fetched. Along with what seemed like a dig at negative reviews of the book as people who didn't understand because they weren't themselves enlightened.I think the underlying message is probably useful and helpful to some people, but wrapped-up in all the spiritual and enlightenment references I quickly gave up. Perhaps it gets better if you persevere, but not for me.I'm sure there must be more down-to-earth, practical books dealing with the subject matter, which I'll now try to find.

At any point on your own journey this couldn't come recommended more highly.

  I was told to give this book a go by a friend, as I've been suffering some work related stress lately - well, who hasn't eh? Anyway, I wasn't sure about how useful reading a book on spiritual enlightenment might be for stress - surely a book on managing stress would be more appropriate?  But, wanting to keep and open-mind, I have bought it and I read a few pages before I go to bed.  I have to say, it does help relieve my stress somewhat - it sends me to sleep...

  Già dalla prefazione si nota una certa presunzione ed una sicurezza velatamente ostentata circa l'efficacia della sua filosofia orientata alla ricerca della felicità. Del resto chiunque si proponga come guida spirituale, un pizzico di presunzione ed arroganza deve necessariamente averla.Detto ciò, il libro sembra puntare molto su un approccio alla vita, al tempo, alle sensazioni e ai sentimenti con una filosofia che se sintetizzata nei principali caratteri assomiglia molto allo Zen.Per quanto letto finora, il tutto, sebbene con ridondanti ammonimenti a non rinnegare famiglia e parenti, si riduce a ""non ti preoccupare del passato"", ""non aver paura del futuro"" ""ascolta te stesso e non i tuoi pensieri che sono frutto del tuo passato e forieri di paure e tristezza, e scoprirai che hai tutto quello che serve per la felicità e la glorificazione del creato""; alquanto Zen a mio parere.Volendo essere un po superficiali si potrebbe dire che, nella semplicità della nostra cultura, tale saggezza l'hanno già cantata i nostri nonni per riprendersi dagli orrori della guerra e faceva più o meno così""Chi ha avuto, ha avuto, ha avuto... chi ha dato, ha dato, ha dato...scurdámmoce 'o ppassato,simmo 'e napule paisá!.. ""Scherzi a parte, ad esser sincero fino in fondo, non sono proprio sicuro di leggere questo libro fino alla fine e se lo farò sarà soltanto perchè è scritto in un inglese scolastico alla mia portata e quindi sarà sicuramente utile come esercizio.Ma chissà che leggendo leggendo io non riesca ad essere inconsapevolmente colpito da un'illuminazione che trasformi il resto della mia vita ... chi lo sa ... potrebbe succedere ... anche se temo di non esser così tanto sensibile.Sperando di esservi stato utile auguro a tutti un ottimo e ponderato acquisto

  This is my second review, based exclusively on the book and not the seller. I read it twice.  A stellar book. I sent this one to my ex-wife. To improve our communication.  And it worked already.  It teaches you how to chill and let by gones be by gones.. You know, be happy no matter what happens. Everybody should read it.  The world would be a lot better place.  And I also read Stillness Speaks and Practicing the Power of now , by the same author,  the latter being the same format as Deepak Chopra,s 'Essential' series.

  I ordered the Audio CD of this book as I travel a lot for work and thought it may be nice to listen to along my way.  Unfortunately  Eckhart Tolle's voice is quite monotone, deep and wispy so it is very hard to pay attention to.  I find my mind wondering a lot and not able to focus on what he is saying.  I have listened to several different audio books while driving and have always found them great, but this one unfortunately makes me want to pull over and take a nap.  His voice is very similar to something you would hear on a meditation or hypnosis track.  The content is great, but another narrator would have been very beneficial.  Most of what he is speaking about, I cannot focus on and absorb.

The QA format is interesting and so far a lot of what caused my problems has been answered in this book.The content could hardly be more verbose for a book that deals with spirituality. Eckhart doesn't try to be cryptic and everything is written towards you, the reader.This book along with 7 Habits of Highly Effective people goes remarkably well. I suggest reading this one first.

  Loved this gem. Reading it again and again. Just one suggestion, when you read, read it slowly, repeat if necessary (sentence, paragraph) to connect with the thought. I find my mind avoiding the flow of the knowledge so that it can avoid being in the present moment...something that mind always does to create false identity with mind. Deep and useful book, indeed.

  Wie wichtig, dass uns jemand in einer einfachen und eingängigen Sprache darauf hinweist, dass wir uns immer wieder auf das Jetzt konzentrieren, gedanklich leer werden müssen, um zu innerer Ruhe und Gelassenehit zu gelangen. (In diesem Sinn ist das Buch eine hervorragende Ergänzung zu Michael Jaegers ""Global Player Faust oder das Verschwinden der Gegenwart"".) Die vollkommene Konzentration auf den gegenwärtigen Augenblick stellt tatsächlich so etwas wie eine Erlösung vom Denken dar, das immer um die Vergangheit oder die Zukunft kreist. Aus der vollkommenen inneren Entspannung heraus können wir anstehende Probleme wieder mit ""neuen"" Augen sehen und sind nicht auf bestimmte Lösungen oder Verhaltensweisen fixiert. So weit, so gut. Sätze wie ""Your primary task is not te seek salvation through creating a better world, but to awaken out of identifiaction with form"" (S. 166) liegen dann aber doch recht weit weg vom westlichem Denken und setzen quasi eine innere ""Bekehrung"" voraus, damit die Welt besser werden kann. Ob man dem Autor so weit folgen will, ist wohl eine persönliche Frage. Für mich ist als Ergänzung zu diesem Buch der AQAL-Rahmen (All Quadrants, All Levels) von Ken Wilber hilfreich. Wir leben nicht nur im Innen, sondern sind auch für das persönliche und gesellschaftliche Aussen verantwortlich. Wie hiess es früher? ORA ET LABORA, übersetzt: Spiritualität ja, aber auch tätige Arbeit!

  I'm still not too sure what to make of this book. The concept of unfogging your mind and using it purely for functional purposes is interesting, the idea that losing any focus on time and living just in the moment is huge and the problem I've found is that far from clearing my mind it is leaving me with even more questions. It is a hard read, lots of information and it can be slow going but it is so informative and convincing that decluttering your mind can have such a huge impact on your life. I am in the process of reading it again to try and get some clarity but I'm finding it such a huge subject that I'm actually getting more confused as I go. But I would still recommend as an interesting read if you have the time to put in (having a 2 year old running round doesn't make quiet reading an easy thing!!). All in all a good read which opens up a whole realm of spiritual possibilities while being just about straight forward enough for the average Joe like myself to ""get it""

  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book - at least the first 50 pages, as it does get a little repetitious. Whilst it is a book of wisdom I must voice some suspicions. Tolle's 'teaching' is not just similar to Barry Long's but very often the phrases are identical. I ask myself why Tolle claimed to need to define the word 'ego' when he uses it in a commonly understood way? It was almost as though he was distinguishing he use of ego from Long's which is that the ego is necessary for survival rather than part of a fabricated self that needs to be dissolved. Tolle leads us to believe he is coming from his own experience - something Long also insisted upon. So sincerity is a concern. Speaking as a meditator myself (on and off for some 30 years) intellectual clarity is a measure of the stillness of the mind and yet at times I wasn't altogether convinced of Tolle's message or even clear as to what it was.Why try to coin the word 'presence' when 'stillness' and 'awareness' need no introduction? It is almost as though Tolle wants to develop a teaching and an identity with it. Comments like, 'The pain body consists of trapped life-energy that has split off from your total energy body field and has temporarily become autonomous through the unnatural process of mind identification.' (p32) seem somehow affected. I wasn't convinced when he wrote, 'A strong unconscious emotional pattern may even manifest as an external event that appears to happen just for you' (p21) and  'Human beings have been in the grip of pain for eons, ever since they fell from grace....' (p25) How does he know it's eons? In fact, what tells him we were ever in grace in the first place?Nevertheless, I would heartily recommend this book, especially to a beginner. Apart from the whiff of platitude, it is largely written from experience but not from a Tathagata well gone - not yet anyway.

  A  must read book for those who struggle to control their mind and can't focus on present moment.What he said in this book is very simple ""present is all we have in life"" ,so we need to focus on present to ""live"" our lives.Whether you like his writing style or not is another thing,you can't deny his argument regarding importance of  present!

  This book made me experience such a deep level of peace that I had never before encountered (Except through a direct experience with God)It teaches you to drop the mental and emotional baggage that you have carried all your life.It teaches you that you are separate from that voice in your head that criticizes, feels sad, feels angry, questions you.. and through that separation you feel peace. It teaches you your truest self: a person of love, lightness and peace. It basically gives you a glimpse of paradise.(I know this sounds really hippe-like and airy fairy but my life has been changed by this book (i bought the book then the audio tape after, I prefer reading, I'm going to be honest)I got the book when I was deeply unhappy, unsatisfied with life and quite depressed. The book ended that for me. I also had really bad hayfever. When I read it, applied it to my life I felt this overwhelming feeling of freedom from past pain, I felt alive, I felt whole and my hayfever symptoms totally disappeared. (it was still the middle of summer and I was still living in the same place.Anyway that is my personal experience. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is grieving, feeling very sad, depressed, alone, frustrated, sick or just wants to experience peace and joy.

  I know how this might sound, but this is probably the best and most important book I've ever read. It has had a profoundly positive effect on me and I credit it with changing the way I see myself, my understanding of my own thoughts and of the world around me.I originally bought this book in 2010 and since then I have bought it several times over as gifts for family and friends. Just like everything else in life, this might not be for everyone. I will admit that I was quite judgemental of the title at the time and I also remember feeling a bit uneasy over even browsing ""self-help"" titles to begin with, but it turned out to be a great decision for me in the end. I was at a challenging point in my life where things just weren't making sense for me anymore, in terms of relationships, religion and life in general. I knew things needed to change in one way or another. I was on a path of self-discovery and I can say without a doubt that this book helped me a great deal.All I can is that if you ever come across this book and you have even the slightest inkling that you might benefit from it in some way, then you should probably listen to your gut and pick it up. You'll be glad you did. Highly recommended.

  I have been one of those people who has ridden the roller-coaster ride of spirituality for the past 45 years of my life. You go through phases, read all the spiritual books, the bible, meditate, yoga, chakras, study naturopathy, live organically and then try to find that happy medium between your religious practice and spirituality. Then after many years you realize that you're still searching for ""who am I, what do I want to be when I grow up, how do I find happiness?"". If this sounds like you, then you're ready for this book. Changed my life forever and after all these years of searching, i finally get it. As Mr. Tolle says, you don't need to search for yourself, because you never got lost in the first place. It's all about being aware, conscious and realizing that suffering comes from our egos and not from who we really are;  our being. It's a must read and even if you don't get it the first time, keep it on your bookshelf because one day you will be ready for it and then you'll know what i mean. Best.

  I ordered this on Thursday morning and it arrived Friday morning. I am only on page 30 and I am consciously making effort to follow it's teachings, since I started everone even strangers have been saying how different I am and how happy I am. I am already feeling more ""high on life"" as you would say, and generally more happy with life after a year of extreme depression. I am also less effected by negative energies and events when I used to have an awful temper even 7 days ago, but since I started reading this I have felt nothing but peace,love and happiness.The teachings seemed a little difficult at first. But just open up to up to the moment and you will find the joy you seek.Remember guys whenever you finish a book pass it on, leave it on a bench or anywhere public, give it to charity.Pay it forward and you will be rewarded.

  I have been reading and trying to more or less consistently get into mindfulness for quite some years now; and this book definetly marked a before and after for me. I started reading this book during a difficult period of my life, during which I was feeling very unwell, and it effectively solved most of my problems by making me realize they are not really as important as they seem.While studying texts about buddhism and meditation will tell you essentially the same thing and Tolle is not stating anything new, the easy and relatable way in which he explain things assist one in gaining a deeper understanding of what enlightement truly means, how to reach it and how it is conductive to one's well being and happiness.

  Very powerful book. It really does ring with truth. There is a lot to it that can change your life. But I agree to the author's opinion in that you need to be ready to be able to get the best out of this book. The thing that I didn't find so helpful is the lack of practical training on how to accomplish what the author is trying to tell you. I guess that's the main reason of why the author has written another book called ""Practicing the Power of Now"" which I haven't read yet but I guess it will satisfy what I couldn't find in this book.

  I bought this book as my husband was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness which has been incredibly hard to deal with.  I heard this book mentioned on Radio 4 and it came with glowing recommendations.  It started well, a bit complex for my simple brain but it was helping.  Then it got more spiritual and deep as it went on and I started to lose interest.  In many ways it was helpful but in some ways it was just too intense - my brain hurt!  My husband was reading a 'Living in the Now' book at the same time as I was reading this.  He found the other book easy to read and very helpful - he was sleeping well while I was still puzzling over what I'd just read - I don't think that's how it's meant to work!

  I recommend this book to every person on the planet,I am of the opinion that it needs to be taught in all schools when the pupils are still of a young age thus enabling them to start life with there eyes open.  Hitler in the days leading too his success in German politics is reported to have said that ""The masses are all blind and stupid""  knowing that, look what that mad man did.  He would not have had such success had the German population been introduced to the contents of this book at a young age.

  The Power of Now, to my mind, is an update of some very old philosophical views.  Mind is the bad boy.  I find myself questioning the actions of someone who when he found his inner 'being' sat in bliss for two years on a park bench.  Who provided for his physical well being during that time? Who provided for his food and clothes? Is it spiritual to live on the backs of others, while enjoying the pure bliss of self-knowledge? Clearly the author must think so, otherwise he would not have included it in his book as an example of how to live.

  Like another reviewer, I've tried more than once over the years to tap into whatever this book appears to have given to so many people but have never managed to stick with it long enough to find it.My latest attempt had me trying to listen to the audiobook but I found the narration irritating and still haven't changed my view that Tolle speaks in riddles without actually saying anything of any real substance before coming back to his message that we should be predominantly non thinking beings.As others have said, I would prefer to master the idea of acknowledging thoughts and emotions and being able to let them go; I find what Tolle advocates comes dangerously close to suggesting we should all become almost catatonic...it provides no real help at all to the question of how to deal with modern life, in my view ...I have to accept after several goes at it, that the book isn't for me.

  I bought this book on the strength of the mixed reviews, it's always good to buy a book and make up your own mind. I have been working my way through a range of books on life, spirituality and enlightenment and thought Tolle's book would make a good addition to my library of books on this subject.I have to say that halfway thought the book, I got what Tolle was trying to impart to the reader, i.e. that living your life based on past events or pinning your hopes on the future can lead to all sorts of mental health problems, as it had done for Tolle himself, who suffered from depression for years.  I found the book a little hard going in places, and he laboured the same point quite a few times. I think I would have enjoyed the book if it was reduced by about a third. There are some very valuable lessons in the book about how to life your life in the now and rid yourself of anxiety, anger and other emotions that can hold you back. So for that reason I have given it 3 stars rather than some of the 1 stars that some reviewers have given it. In essence there is a good book in there, it's just hidden in too many words and I think that for some people, like me they will find it a little hard going at times.

  Despite the fact that Tolle claims to have written this book only upon request from other people, this man, like so many others, seems to have the mission of convincing the world that what worked for him must be the solution to all earthly problems.Anyhow Tolle's analysis and ""method"" of getting to the Now is quite powerful, helpful and can in fact change your life to the better.However, Tolle having found this new focus point in the prsence, now falls into the trap of making it the center of a world view, overly generalizing the results and judging everything from this/his newly aquired standpoint.He is quick to draw ""obvious"" conclusions, quote from every monumental book our civilization has brought forth (the Bible, the Koran, the Tao, etc.) and interpreting the quotes within a paragraph in the light or as a proof of the ""power of now"".And, like many converts, who have lived through a dramatic turning point in their lives, he is very willing to condemn everything else, and especially everything which actually correlates with his ""previous"" life, as insane or mad.This book carries a great message but you will have to be careful to draw your own conclusions and discern the basic truths from the personal problems, which are mainly related to the Tolle-Personality rather than yourself.

  I was running a difficult period, as my girlfriend left me after five years and half. I built a vision of the future that I saw collapsing from one day to the other, and then when she left I couldn't stop my mind from racing: I really felt trapped by the past, by all the questions that I had and by the vision of the future that was fading away. I really need help to overcome it, and the words of the friends and relatives were echoing in my mind ""You need time to overcome it"".I'm so glad I did not simply listen to them and wait for the pain to heal by itself as I started reading this book. I'm half-way now but I already felt the shift in consciousness: past, future and time are just illusions of my mind, and I am not my mind. There's nothing left but this very moment, the Now. When you realize, you simply let go the past and still the mind and perceive your real consciousness... you look around you and see everything glowing, feel the shyvers along your back and gain Grace.There are several books about Awakening that I tried to read in the past, but they did not help. It could be because I was not ready... It seems a paradox, but running through difficulties facilitates the Awakening.Thank you Eckhart for writing and sharing this gem. I needed it.

  I have read many great self-help books in the past, but after reading this book, I felt like that’s it for me in the self-help genre for the rest of my life.  Sure, the author could’ve explained the concepts better, using more specific examples that relate to many of us, but don’t let the book’s readability fool you.  The concepts in the book are so deep and profound that this book dwarfs all the other self-help books in my opinion.  A must-read for everyone!

  If you are a human you can determine when your thoughts invade your daily existance.  This is not rocket science. Somehow this author believes that his advice is singular in form and substance.

  I recommend this book to all my clients who I think can handle it. (Some people just aren't ready and can't begin to understand the concepts). The concept is simple, yes. All truly deep truths are very simple. But how do you do it?  It is not easy explaining something that really can only be experienced, but hats off to Tolle for doing an amazing job.I have been a student of psychology, am a full time therapist and find this the single most helpful tool to living a peaceful life. We cannot trust our emotions, which are always either being triggered by past events or future worries. We can trust in a higher plan - and the way to do that is through every single moment. God said I AM. not I was. not I will be. I AM. You can only ever find absolute truth in the present moment, in the NOW.If you ever wondered *how* to 'live in the Spirit', then this is the book you need to read. Tolle stumbled upon this truth and was given a gift to be able to communicate it to others. It may lead you to many places you thought you would never go.

  This book has really captivated my attention during the first 50 pages. A lot of things Eckhart Tolle says about the world we live in is true, and I think we would all benefit from living more in the present than we do. However, I think it would be too simplistic to summarise life to Now, and to make it the only possible way of living happily. As for everything in life there are pluses and minuses to everything, the way in which we live now is not all negative, so we have to keep the good things from it. Also I think the book was lacking solid arguments after a while and it was recycling the same idea over and over again as if to persuade us it was the right way to live.

  I've read this book 3-4 times in English and in German. On my first reading I would have given the book 5 stars: it seemed to give all the answers to achieving happiness.However, as I put into practice the instructions I find that I do not get the effects that are talked about: dissolution of the future and the past and therefore liberation from pain/madness.Of course others will say that I am just not present enough... not doing it correctly... but I wonder how enlightened they are or how much they have just ""bought"" this argument and are defending it with their ego?For example, there have been things that make me really angry/depressed/frustrated/create lots of mind chatter... and as I start to observe those thought patterns and emotions within myself without judging them I actually find that the negativity is magnified. Then after a short period of time I revert to simply being negative without observing. So of course I am not doing it right... but who is? Who is able to take a real knock in their life and just by observing their own reactions to it dissolve the negativity? I doubt the 5 star reviewers in this book can... if they have reached these jesus like heights then please let me know (as long as you don't have mad staring eyes)!I found that the questions being asked (the book is written in a question and answer form) were the wrong ones... Let me loose and I would ask the difficult questions.I have been seeking for a while now and I have not found... maybe this book brought me closer. Certainly I take evreything what the author says very seriously and the argument is very convincing, but the sustained practice of what is preached I think is beyond 99.99% of the population... in fact the author says as much when he talks of a cataclysmic event in someone's life being the most common route to enlightenment or the experience that we have just before death. Maybe that is true... I guess if that was the central thesis then not so many copies would be sold...

  I think this book would be pretty useful for some people and some of the stuff is really great. I just really disliked the way the story is brought. The author openly claims to have obtained a spiritual enlightenment and is quite dramatic in the way he tells the story, to the point you start to doubt it. Besides the whole way of telling the story seemed way too arrogant and gives an almost compulsive vibe, which is exactly the opposite of what I expected out of it.Maybe I'll have to give it another try but from what I've read it's just not that good.

  Like so many people, I had heard the hype for many years about what a great and transformative book this is.  However, this book is very poorly written and makes numerous claims that just make no sense, e.g. 'even a stone has rudimentary consciousness' and also several instances of informing the reader who needs to pay his or her bills tomorrow that they don't actually have any problems, just 'life situations'.  I imagine that is rather easy to say when you've become a multi-millionaire creating self-help books like this one.  I've read some really great books on spirituality, but in my opinion, this is not one of them.  Time Magazine famously wrote that this book was 'mumbo jumbo' and I wish I had heeded their warning.

I have learnt so much about my thinking, my depression, my marriage, my divorce but most of all the Bible has been opened up to me in a completely new light and parts of it that always seemed incomprehensible now seem simple and accessible.

  I am rather disappointed with this book. One reviewer on Amazon was right when he said that halfway through the book, religion (in the form of Christianity) sneaks in and starts to pervade the entire content. That really really puts me off and undermines the credibility of what the author is trying to say.Basically, this book is an introduction to Zen meditation, mixed with Christianity, Buddism and all sort of new-age psychobabble. It makes ample use of pseudoscience, talking about 'energy fields' and 'vibrational energy' and other stuff like that. I'm a very open-minded reader (currently learning about the chakras system) but even to me, the way this stuff is presented is hard to take seriously. Some of his ideas are also questionable, such as the idea that you should never think of the past, or day dream, but rather live in this state of blissful apathy. I really am not sure how this will give you happiness.However on the plus side, the book does introduce you to meditation, in particular Zen. I just think there are better sources to learn that from, rather than this God/Jesus/Christianty infested variety. It also does give you snippets of advice that you will find useful.But overall, another hyped up disappointment.

  This is my favourite mainstream spiritual book as it presents the kernel of spirituality stripped away from the outer layers of religion, school or sect. It is the gist of what buddhists, yogis and meditator are trying to convey.There is ineffable meaning and joy in the deep experience of being, in the eternal now. Fears, worries, likes/dislike and problems are a projection of the ego, which the mind has conjured and then become attached to, obscures our ability to see reality as it really is. Attachment and ignorance really do cause suffering and Tolle is one of the few new age luminaries who it would seem is geniunely self realised. Once you have begun to experience Presence though, unless you have the simplicity of life to progress with purely passive contemplative meditation (like a renunciate)you may need to consider stronger techniques like taoist internal alchemy or kriya yoga to consolidate your realisation.For now though, why wait? A happier life lies with your choice to respond through a more authenticate being. Buy this book now.

  First I was a little apprehensive - Tolle seemed like one of these lifestyle 'gurus', famous and probably making a good share of money. But actually I loved this book and I really took the learnings to my heart. This book will make a great personal gift to a loved one as well.Tolle has a great knowledge of Buddhist teachings, he knows all the typical psychological theories around it.He describes the 'pain body', how the mind will prevent you from really being aware and present now and here. There are many down-to-earth exercises that anyone could do to understand everything a little better - the world, the people in it and yourself! I found this really helpful with my own little meditation sessions.On the cover it says 'every sentence rings with truth and power' - this is true throughout the book. Don't be afraid though, Tolle is not inventing any new ground breaking, super innovative theories, he mostly relies on knowledge that is already there and puts this into easy to understand language for everybody.So, yes, if you want a book that gives you some little thought starters, and if you are OK and ready to self reflect (not many people are truly open to doing that!), then you will find this book can bring great benefit.

  本書、さとりへのガイドと英語の副題にある通りの内容です。読めば、さとりが開けるようになるわけではありません。さとりをひらこうとするのは、個人のマインドやエゴの働きです。人生をシンプルで楽にするために、さとりをひらくのでもありません。自分の内側に、スペースを作って待つ、必要なこと、できることはそれだけです。(Spaciousness, alert waiting)そしてそれで、必要十分なのです。やっと、分かりかけてきました。英語はやや不安だが、Eckhart Tolleの原書に触れてみたい、そんな方はA New Earthよりこちらのほうが辞書片手に読みやすいと思います。さらに英語に不安がある方は、Stillness Speaksから入ってみてください。10/5追記購入してから１年と少し、７月初旬にさとりらしきものがやってきました。あまりにあっけなく、なんだ、こういうことだったのかという感じでした。A New Earthもですが、字面を眺めて分かった気にならず、意味を消化しながらゆっくりと、時には立ち止まりながら読むのがこういう本には良いようです。エゴは相変わらず自分を乗っ取ろうとしてきます。でも、本来の自分を垣間見たので、何とか自分を取り戻すことができています。オプラは何回も読み直し、家のいたるところに何冊も置いてあるといっていました。自分も見習い、毎日少しでも読み続けたい、そんな１冊です。

  Arrived really quickly but unfortunately didn't like the book! Very repetitive, basically says the same things over and over again. I didn't like the question and answer format of the book and also it just seemed to highlight that the questions really were not answered. This book is basically the ""presentism"" time theory repeated over and over with some Buddhist teachings thrown in out of context.I appreciate that reading this book may be the first time some people are made aware of the concepts like presentism / mindfulness/ law of attraction etc mentioned..but there are much better books out there on similar topics

  I have read 'The Power of Now' and 'Practising The Power of Now' three times!Two times in English, and also one time in a bad Swedish translation.If I had written this review after the first time I read the books, I would have given both books 5 stars without no doubt.Anyhow since it was some years ago, and so many already then had reviewed the books I didn't write anything.During the years read a lot about Buddhism, in several languages, and keep so doing,I ordered from Amazon Tolles 'Now books' again, since the first were so full of notes etc.I also ordered 'A New Earth' and 'Stillness Speaks', these two are still unread....What makes me give the author only one star, is that it's 100% stolen from Buddhism.OK, a bit mixed and some 'own ideas', but everything essential is 'borrowed' from the Buddhistic philosophy.Only made more unclear and messy....and I also get an irritating feeling of the worst word I know, -ism.Tolle-ism or Eckhart-ism....That's why many people and also I, dislike the word Buddhism, but it's so established now, so we have to live with it:-)When you read perhaps the best and most truthful book about Buddhism, plus it's much nicer to read,'Buddhism-plain and simple',  by Steve Hagen, you will find a crystal clear explanation....of Buddhism,and it feels more modern than 'The Power of Now' !!Already to many has bought 'The Power of Now', I even bought three sets + two more books :-)Sorry Mr Tolle, but the original is best,so may it be philosophy, music or movies!Don't forget the first author, Hermann Hesse, and Siddharta (1922), still in pocket!I read it first 1973 and last time just  two weeks ago!

  忘れられない過去に囚われている人には特にお勧めです。この本の概要は以下になります。過去の悪かったことについて考えると、後悔や怒りがわいてきます。過去の良かったことについて考えると、それと比べて今を不幸に感じます。未来の良いことについて考えると、現在はそれに至っていないと不幸に感じます。未来の悪いことについて考えると不安になります。なので、過去や未来にとらわれず、今に意識を集中することが大切。そのためには、自分の今の思考と感情は、過去、今の一瞬、未来のどこを見ているかを意識する必要があります。英語としては平易ですが、内容は奥深いので、ゆっくり噛み締めながら読む感じです。

  I read the first chapter of this book and felt the author could have stopped there and have just as much impact. I read the remainder of the book and this belief still stands. Having experience God's presence as something that is part and yet different from who I am, my only disagreement with the author is his conceptualization of what, who, how, where God is. The awakened spirit has wisdom of the past, present, and the future. I am not sure why he does not refer to ""awakening one's spirit"" as oppose to awakening to ""now"". Regardless the book is timeless and powerful. I am sure the creator is pleased with most of it.

  A friend recommended this and said it had changed the way he thought about things, for the better. However, I couldn't get on with it. I found it repetitive and couldn't get beyond the self help aspect of it so stopped reading after the first part. My adult son felt the same when he tried to read it.

  I am a counselling psychologist and the book is written by  someone with less than a grain of insight into how the brain and layers of consciousness work, but has tried to write a whole book based on one idea/tool (which i feel he makes a very bad attempt at i.e. MINDFULNESS).  I finally lost all respect when he tried to describe the emotion of pain as an entity 'PAIN BODY' trying to live through us and take us over. How this man made money from the book is worrying. More worrying is the damage that can be done to the poor people who absorb this  book as fact. Mindfulness/being present in the moment is a valuable tool to help with the stress created by our issues and problems. It provides temporary relief/changes in brain patterns and altered brain chemistry by changing our inward focus from our problems to an outward focus such as the breath or nature. Reading a good book or being totally focused on a stimulating TV programme is beingfocused in the moment and can also alter our brain wave patterns leading to a more relaxed state.  We still have to face and solve our problems. A homeless person struggling with addiction is not going to solve their problems by mindfulness alone.

  Other reviewers have used the terms elitist, convoluted and repackaged Eastern/Buddhist philosophy. Some have also said how confusingly expressed. I would agree with all that.I do believe it possible the Tolle has had an enormous shift in his outlook and perceptions brought about by the traumatic overload he described in his experience, but in my view he overestimates his enlightenment and appears to believe he is now qualified to talk knowledgeably beyond his true limited range.I also looked at a few videos of Mr Tolle on youtube and bought an audio CD to see if I could get on with it, but could finish neither the book or audio cd. I tried more than once. There are many discrepancies in my opinion.I prefer my Eastern/Buddhist philosophy a little more authentic and would recommend starting with something like Steve Hagen's Buddhism plain and simple.

  I probably should have expected the contents of this book but was taken in by the positive reviews. I had expected some intelligent thought about enjoying the present more, knowing what matters. I get that.What I don't understand is why it has to be buried in piles of pseudo-religious made-up drivel. This is basically one bloke's rant about a series of invented ideas which he presents as a third party, as if he's just taking notes on some absolute truth that you can't possibly disagree with (having spent two years ""living on park benches in a state of joy""). Within the first few pages, science is dismissed as being limited by what you can prove (how silly), anyone who disagrees is just confused or ""egoic"", all religions are wrong, and Descartes made a basic error.And where does this incontrovertible truth come from?

  If this book was a sandwich, and ""woo"" was mayonnaise, then the ratio of condiment to other ingredients was okay in the first few bites. I like the idea of staying in the present, and agree that as a society we are increasingly less happy due to focus on the future. But as I continued to bite into this thing it lost any ingredients of substance, until it was just mayo slathered between two thick slices of mystical mumbojumbo.In the right proportion a little woo can be okay. I liked The Alchemist and the self-help classic, ""Creative Visualization"". I even got through the Celestine Prophecy. But Power of Now was too much.There are parts of the book that are totally confusing and sometimes self-contradictory. If you don't get it then you're just not enlightened enough. I remember reading something like, ""Don't focus on the words. You can call it whatever."" (Okay then what is it?)There's the apocalyptic warning: ""when we talk about (consciousness) we are personalizing an event that is truly of cosmic significance..."" (Drum roll) ""... the end of the world."" Then, with question marks spinning around my head I read into the very next paragraph, where it states ""the egoic mind (unconsciousness) is the most dangerously insane and destructive entity ever to inhabit the planet."" So it seems we can't win, conscious or unconscious.The book suggests that the modern collective rise to consciousness is the second coming of Christ, which is an unexpected twist, but that's where the book starts to get too gooey for me and it didn't get better after that.

  What a disappointment. Eckhart Tolle states his opinion about psychology, metaphysics, religion, life after death and an array of other subjects without ever studied in those fields. This collection of theories, stated as fact in a patronizing manner often made me laugh out loud. There is nothing original in this book. It is regurgitated guesswork based on hearsay of better-studied men, and fluffed for bulk.

  As a lifetime scholar and seeker of truth I am always searching for meaningful and unique books. This particular book (The power of NOW: A guide to spiritual enlightenment by Eckhart Tolle) was recommended to me by a friend and since it was a best seller in the past, I decided to purchase the 193 page hardcover book from Amazon for a bargain price.After reading the first four chapters I became bored and suspicious. This is because the so-called epiphany the author experienced which inspired him to write this book is nothing more than rehashed Taoism, Zen, mysticism, Buddhism, and Indian Yoga philosophy.  In fact, the entire book can be summarized in one sentence:  “The past and future are not real and to achieve happiness and enlightenment you MUST ONLY FOCUS ON THE NOW.”Maybe I have studied too many Far Eastern Philosophy books over the last 65 years, because after finishing this book I found absolutely nothing new or enlightening in this volume.The ten chapters cover the following material: You are not your mind, consciousness: the way out of pain, moving deeply into the now, mind strategies for avoiding the now, the state of presence, the inner body, portals into the unmanifested, enlightened relationships, beyond happiness and unhappiness there is peace, and the meaning of surrender.Rating:  3 Stars.

  Is how the first 60-70 pages of this book can be summed up. Not bad advice, just a bit perplexing that he takes so many words to say it, and that so many millions apparently consider this a revelation.It's difficult to be entirely negative about a book that appears to have positively affected so many lives, so I've tried very hard to keep an open mind... but all I can manage is a sort of head-scratching sense of bewilderment - what is all the fuss about?I agree with the sentiments of the beginning of the book entirely (although I'm sure the total believers will say that, if I don't feel 'transformed' then I can't have understood it properly) - and in fact have often found myself saying similar things to people who have a general life-malaise or sense of depression not linked to a particular problem that they can take action to try to fix: life is short, and you don't want to get to your old age and look back on a life of unhappiness. So try to find pleasure and happiness in every moment that you can now; take action to create the life that you want now, learn from the past but don't obsess, and accept the things you cannot change and move on.The above is all very good advice - I just don't see that it is all that earth shattering.By about page 80 or 90, I realised that this is just another book about A Course in Miracles (ACIM). For ACIM to be a useful philosophy to you, you have to believe in an eternal consciousness/God of which you are part. The vast majority of Americans do, which is probably why this book is so popular. If you don't however, then the book is just going to become a disappointing mish mash of new age gobbledegook that doesn't really answer anything satisfactorily. And I haven't even touched upon the inconsistencies littered throughout.On the other hand, the fact remains that many many people found this very helpful, a revelation in fact. For which I can only conclude, if it helps you, do it.

  Eckhart Tolle is brilliant! If you're seeking inner peace, this is a great place to start.  Will probably require multiple readings to truly grasp what he's saying on a deeper level, although the initial concepts are easy to comprehend and absorb. Essentially, we find ourselves by losing ourselves - but we don't recognize ourselves as a mental construct or ""me"" entity, but rather we just are. So you're not actually finding yourself in the traditional sense, but rather realizing your true self by letting go. In Zen terms, it's sort of like saying that the best way to hit the target is to forget about the target, and just melt into the moment. We are free when we can do this - free of unhappiness, moodiness, anxiety, judgments, labels, etc. There's much more to this book than just ""living in the moment"" - although that's the basic premise.  But it's flushed out in a way that is profound. A life changing book for sure!

  The writer is nearly impossible to follow. The word selection is nonsensical and struggles deeply to make any real points. He jumps from topic to topic saying how you're wrong and everything you're doing is wrong. He offers little insight of how to change this other than to stop doing it. He at multiple times in the book states you don't understand what he's talking about and to just listen. For someone who speaks so negatively on ego, his is huge.

  I’ve been an over-thinker for most of my adult life. I even felt proud about nearly constantly thinking and analyzing. I was an intellectual, a deep thinker. What I didn’t understand is that thinking was holding me hostage. I dwelt mostly in the world of my past, where things seemed rosier, and the future, where things would either get better or become a catastrophe. I very rarely was here, in the present moment. The Power of Now showed me how insane that way of living was, how my repetitive thought patterns and emotional reactions kept me deeply unhappy. I read the book cover to cover, pausing to reflect but not really think about Tolle’s teachings. Something happened to me during that first reading. My thoughts stopped controlling me. I was able to be more present during more of my day. I became the watcher of my thoughts. I was suddenly able to choose what thoughts I wanted to believe, and which ones didn’t serve me or kept me unhappy. I can honestly say that today, I am largely free of painful thoughts, and I can use thinking as a tool rather than a way of living my life. In all fairness, Tolle’s writing can be dry and repetitive. Some of the concepts he discusses have taken me several reads to fully grasp, and others I realize I cannot understand through the mind. The book can be easy to dismiss, as some readers have. We all want an end to suffering, and that way is to go behind the mind to a level of awareness, as Tolle puts it. If you want joy and peace, I strongly encourage you to read this book. Read it in its entirety, and from a level beyond simply thinking. If you allow it to, if you truly want to put an end to suffering, The Power of Now will change your life.

  In December 2005 I received this book as a Christmas gift. I made several attempts to read it and meditate, but only finished reading it today (19 August 2018). By this time I have been practising meditation for years.Tolle has patiently articulated a distillate of the value of contemplation, meditation, and living from Being, as opposed to reacting from unconscious habits.Had I stubbornly plodded through the book a decade ago I would have rejected its teachings just because I wasn't ready to receive them. I was brought up in a fundemantalist Protestant family and self-identified as such for most of my life.I heartily recommend this book to be read once, and meditation to be practiced every day. Tolle may be on to something here. As more and more people become Enlightened, we might usher in a new Earth, which is, sadly, ruled right now by personified egos such as Putin, Kim Jong Un, Rodrigo Duterte, and Donald Trump.

  I have read many self-help books in my life, but not one has ever had the same impact on my life as the 'The Power of Now'.Every word 'oozes' absolute truth and it can only have been inspired by the author first having had a life that made no sense.  As a result, the  author Eckhart Tolle had a total breakdown, but like a phoenix rising from the ashes and with more than a little help from The Buddha's teachings he analysed his life situation andfound that the basic problem was that his mind was 'all noise'from living in the past and thinking 'it will be alright in the future'. Recognise any similarities with yourself anybody?Solution, get this book and start practicing  with a conscious mind and living in the present moment.Banish guilt, regret and grievences from your life.  Learn to forgive and find peace. Recognise that the mind is basically all ego and that much of it is based on false characteristics, trying to be something that it is not, seeking power and influence that cannot be sustained.  Where do you finish up?  Often rejected by the world.Living in the present moment does not mean withdrawing from modern society or even material possessions.  What it does mean is living from a deeper perspective from within yourself, the 'inner being'and finding fulfilment well away from where you thought you would find it, somewhere on the outside.The way Eckart Tolle describes the concept is not difficult to understand, but it will require consistent practice.  Follow his clear directions and you will be able to experience relief immediately, even if only momentarily.Buy this book, read it, re-read, practice its teachings and you will be on the road to a full, spiritually based (not religious), life that could only be dreamed of without it.

  After reading a selection of reviews I thought I would write my own. I completely understand the reason for the negative reviews but this book was not written for those people at this time. The point of the book is about becoming more aware and waking up in order to see things for what they truly are. For us that is rising above our mental filters, views and belief systems which are often distorted and destructive. Quite often it takes major life events for us to question our personal mental structures. This is exactly what happened to me and now I am so glad it did.So in my opinion, this book is most likely to help you if:1) You are having (major) challenges in life and your ""normal"" ways of coping are not working.2) You are wondering what life is all about and are not finding any truly fulfilling answers.3) And most importantly you are OPEN to looking at life in different ways.This book is unlikely to help you if:1) You do not want / are not ready for a shift in consciousness.2) You are not open and prepared to question your own belief systems and views on life.3) You focus more on the way things are written rather than look for the underlying message.Look around, life needs us to wake up and this book is one of many tools available to help us do that!Peace ;-D

  I bought the Power of Now largely on the strength of the high ratings.  There is nothing particularly new in the book, it seems to be a pick and mix of various world philosophies/religious beliefs, a dollop of psychology and what I presume are the author's own inventions.  I have given what I consider a generous 3 stars because a large proportion of what he writes is common sense, some areas are quite thought provoking - unfortunately there are elements I can only describe as weird.I wouldn't say don't buy this book - what I would say is, if it appeals to you, get it but as in all things use your own judgement, be discerning in what you take from this book.

  Modern Day Charlatan whose trying to fool the masses.  This book is zen buddhism etc, it has been written in the west extensively by many authors, two famous being Dr. Wayne Dwyer and Deepak Chopra who have written a pop versions of the  Eastern philosophies.  This author is a second rate charlatan trying to jump on the bandwagon of Eastern mysticism.Book summation:  Don't live in the past or the future; live in the present.  Your mind is not You so try and be a witness to all that goes on inside your head instead of being yourself.  Kindda like looking in the mirror and saying that's him (not me).  Yeah silly right ??  So why all the 5 stars ??  Because most people are insecure and need to find and hold onto something. This book gives them something to hold onto. For example, if you have failed at something, then the book gives you an escape route. You haven't failed -  'he/she - your ego has"" but that wasn't You..........lol.

  Being a Yoga and Tai Chi teacher for 20 years l am constantly having to remind my students that living in the now or the present moment is neither a yogic or Buddhist idea and should be left at the door with their shoes. The Buddha says in the Dhammapada,  ""Let go of your attachment to the past, the PRESENT and the future, and be free"" verse 348.I find it quite disturbing how these new - age concepts like the law of attraction and the power of now hijack subtle and sophisticated Eastern philosophies and dumb them down to one dimensional cardboard cut-outs.This book is typical of the Western mind, trying to put time in a box called the now and telling you, ""stay in that box,  it's a good place"". The Buddha, Yoga, Advaita, the Tao and others on the other hand urge us to throw the box into the river, and go with the natural flow of time.There are times to project into the past, times to project into the future and times to focus in the present, which is  inseparably linked to both - the key is to develop the mindful skill in knowing what is appropriate and when.The Now seems to have hijacked the mentality of mainstream culture l think because it's the ugly twin to instant gratification. A truly awful book.

  This book has changed my entire outlook on life. I already ordered a few more copies for family and friends because I wrote all over the margins in mine. The content substantially helped quell some of my anxiety and depression. I'm a fast reader, and this took me a surprisingly long time to get through, only because it's pretty mind-boggling to process some of Tolle's 'considerations,' for lack of a better word, but in a good way.I kept waiting for one of his teachings, concepts, or suggestions to feel too ""hippie"" for me to be able to take seriously or put into practice, but every piece of information he shares is clear, concise, and if you open your mind, can be easily be accepted, and what's more, put into practice in your everyday life to make things better for you and everyone around you. I highly recommend it and wish I'd gotten my hands on it sooner.

  This book depressed me to tears.  Reading it brings up such horrid feelings of inadequacy, as if I am a bad person because I can't ""feel the vibration of my body's energy.""  I had the same reaction to the book The Cloud of Unknowing.  Tolle makes meditation sound effortless.  I have tried since I was 35.  I am now 60. I am no better at not thinking than I was at 35. So this makes me unenlightened and a useless Christian?  This makes me ""less than"" all the millions of others who can clear their minds, ignore the ""pain-body,"" whatever that is, and become one with space-time. It seems to me that this is yet another salvation by works or one's efforts. I am a firm believer in spiritual disciplines, but why must mine be like Tolle's?  I believe there is more than one way to commune with God. God speaks to me differently, and that's just fine with me. It's too bad Tolle has to insist on his way. And by the way, this is all so freaking serious that when I wasn't depressed, I was giggling at the terminology like ""pain-body"" and ""luminous splendor of the colorless light of Emptiness."".I felt like an eight-year-old in church whenever we sang ""Rock-a My Soul In the Bosom of Abraham.""  I am so very happy that this book has helped so many very sick people, but my sicknesses are apparently beyond the scope of this book.

  I love reading books for personal development and this was a CD I bought after seeing so many good reviews. It is all too much of airy-fairy talk with no practical use. I do agree that being in the now is a important thing to do but too much emphasise is being put on being in the now. The solution is all problems is being in the now. Any question asked, the solution is about being in the now. Got a bit fed up of the repetetion. I like books which give me a much more flexible humanistic views rather than unachievable divine standards which set you up to fail. Sorry!

  Most of our unease comes from either the past or the future—waiting for something (good or bad) or dwelling over something that has already passed. You can find peace by focusing directly on what you're doing in this moment. Narrowing your focus to your feet on the ground amd the air in your lungs will serve as a much needed break for many people. Learn to appreciate ""the Now"" because everything you have and will ever experience will be in the present.This type of awareness starts by being a witness of your mind. If you find yourself being swept away by your thoughts or emotions, noticing it and understanding that you are not your thoughts but you are the one that has them and can do with them what you please will give you power when you need it. Many people identify with their unmanaged thoughts and past pain and consequently project it outward. Taking control of your own mind, simply by witnessing what it does, will give you the power to direct your life.I try not to criticise but this book was a solid 1/10 because of the irrelevant topics, new-age nihilism, philosophical gaps, and contradictions. Overall, a very inefficient and scattered book.

  I read this book and learned a lot about myself and life. I was shocked to read the pages and find myself saying.....I do this, I did that, that is how I feel. The book really got to the root of the problems in my life (my mind) and explained to me how I can correct these problems. Once I began using the advice in the book I noticed positive changes in my life and I started to feel alive, fresh and content. I have not felt this way since I was very young. This book has really started off a life transformation within me.If I could sum up this book in a few words, it would be like this........The book is like finding a map to peace and contentment inside you, that you never knew that was there.Thank you Eckhart Tolle.

  This book offers many great passages on how our minds and egos can be the most destructive forces in our lives. We are conditioned by society to always live in the future or the past as opposed to simply living in the moment. We have computers and technology that help connect us accross distances but lead us further away from the people that are right next to us. How many times are we glued to computer/phones while we ignore the world around us. People search for answers to Life's greatest questions in religons that want you to believe that there's a paradise waiting for us after death. Why should such such a paradise exist if we can't be there right this moment? If it causes us to forget about all the joys and experiences we encounter during life why should we have so much hope for it?There is much potentail to what the author lays out in this book but it is up to the reader to follow what is written. While some people may not agree with some aspects of the book or feel that there is too much repition the central message is clear: Start living in the NOW and stop letting your mind control your life. This is not one of those books you should read fast but would be great in small chunks. Any philsosophical text requires one to read a passage and take some time to digest/think about what they read. I puchased the Audible version of this book as well and feel it would be great to listen to passages while on walks through nature or just during meditations. The fact that the author himself narrates the book adds another layer to the information he presents.During my reading/listening of this book I never found any strong religious overtones so while there a some Biblical references he does bring in some Buddhist concepts as well as Taoist ideas. It's not a preachy book in that sense which kept me reading (It probably would have deterred me from reading it otherwise). I don't have much of a relgious background (my family did not have any religious affiliation growing up) which is why I find the ideas in the book easier to accept over the literal interpretations of, say, the Bible. I think anyone regardless of religious affiliation would find something in this book that would coincide with what they already practice.This book is something I look forward to rereading/listening to in the future (which doesn't exist if you accept what the author states) during walks though nature. I recommend the audiobook version because the author does a good job with the narration and it wasn't much of an extra cost for it.

  Wow, what a book! I truly believe in meditation being a very powerful tool; I think awareness is the greatest gift you can give yourself.And so, nothing in this book is really new, but nevertheless it had some huge eye-openers for me. I as blown away by the whole explanation about the egoic mind constantly trying to divert us away from the present moment, constantly creating dissonance - irritation, impatience, annoyance, etc., to separate us from the Now and create resistance with our situation; how the ego needs to do this to survive. That's when I saw the impact on my own daily life (and inner peace) and increased my own understanding and awareness overall.I highly recommend this book of anyone practicing meditation and seeking balance with life and within themselves

  I am in the process of splitting up with my wife of 12 years.  This is has been the single biggest challenge in my life to date. The confrontation, the bitterness of recent years and the short term uncertainty in terms of how things are going to play out can take a heavy toll.  If you search the web, you will find lots of tips about how to survive divorce. I have chosen for counselling, fitness and some spirituality.I am glad that I have chosen for spirituality, that's not to say that I am about to grow a beard, put on a pair of sandals and a horsehair shirt, more of a case of trying to discover where perhaps I have gone wrong in the recent past and I how I might change things so that I might live a happier life in the future.Eckhart Tolle has certainly helped me to create more focus,  I have come to realise how much time I have spent worrying about things, rather than doing things, enjoying life and being me.I have had the book a few weeks and I can say that it has made a difference.  I can detach myself from mulling over the past and my hopes for a better future. Now I am able to concentrate on what I need to do now to reconcile the past and/or what I need to now to create a better future.I found the first few pages difficult, fundamentally, that was down to my state of mind. I was not open to absorb what I was reading.I am not sure what finally pushed me to persevere, I am glad I did.  It is not the kind of book that you can read in a day, you need to read it, reflect on it and try it.  I will be honest some of the book is very abstract, if you can get beyond that and try some of the exercises, you will feel a benefit.Oprah Winfrey has had umpteen copies and she raves about it on You Tube, Eckhart Tolle can also be found there.  Maybe try before you buy, you will need to a copy of the book to really understand the Power Of Now.

  This book, and its author, Eckhart Tolle, have changed my life for the better! (It's going to be hard to keep this review short.)I started reading this book after I went through a very tough time in my life. In late 2018, I was introduced to a kind of yoga practice. The first step in the practice is to finish an online course and practice a few stretching exercises, basic breathing exercises and chanting. It probably works fine for most people, but in my case, it messed me up big time! I started having trouble controlling my energies, lost sleep (just sleeping 2 or 3 hours a night) and was working like crazy at job... Then I went manic. Though I wanted to stop the yoga practice, I couldn't. It was like a drug at that time! I started talking too much at home and work. People started getting scared of me, since I was pointing out things from their lives that they were themselves only peripherally aware of. I eventually lost my job and almost lost my family too! It took me a few months to realize what had just happened. After that manic phase, I went into severe depression. I had no job, a very strained relationship with my wife, and was blaming myself incessantly. I also stopped the yoga practice around this time. A few months later, when I realized I couldn't handle it myself, with the help and support of my wife, I went to a psychiatrist... and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder... (I now know through this book that all illnesses are just temporary situations to deal with. I have no identity with the situation. The reason I am mentioning the label here is to help others who might have gotten this label, or other such labels. Right now I am on medication (200 mg daily of a mood stabilizer, called lamotrigine). I see that it helps me, for now. But I don't buy my psychiatrist's argument that I have to carry that label for the rest of my life. I was doing just fine for 40 years before the yoga practice... and the situation might change in the future. For now, I am going along with the recommended plan since it is working well and I accept it totally.)The only things that pulled me out of that deep pit was total faith in a Guru (who is not living in His body anymore) and probably, the medicine too. At that time, I had to totally lean on faith, since I had no strength myself. The ego had gotten such a heavy beating that it became extremely scared and depressed. Every moment was torturous and I could do nothing about it. I wanted to commit suicide, but having been raised with strong Hindu spiritual teachings, I knew that suicide would only temporarily postpone the inevitable, and that I would take another life and face the exact same situation. (I don't know if that is true or not; it at least prevented me from committing suicide.)This book was referred to me in December of 2018 (when I was in full blown mania) by someone whom I met at a bookstore. I knew about the book, but had never read it. The next day, I found a used copy of ""The New Earth"" by Eckhart for $3 in a used book store. I bought it, but couldn't read it since I didn't have any concentration. The moment I read one sentence, my mind took off and I could see where Eckhart was going... (At that time, my mind was telling me there was nothing I didn't know.)Only in November of 2019, after I went through a full cycle of mania and depression, and was slowly recovering, I borrowed a copy of ""The Power of Now"" from the local library and started reading it.The very first practice of ""watching the thinker"" was a revelation... Especially the statement Eckhart made about not judging the thoughts and just watching the mind... I was mostly aware of what was going on in my mind, but I was criticizing the mind the moment it produced what I judged as a ""wrong"" thought. This created a lot of suffering. It was a huge relief to me that all I need is to just watch it and be the witnessing Presence.Later, Eckhart talked about ""watching the inner body"" to take attention away from the mind when it's not needed. This helped me during my job interviews. I had always felt anxious about job interviews... This practice really helped me through that challenge. (I did fine in the interviews and usually got good offers, but the anxiety was so much that my palms and feet would always sweat.)The book doesn't get into the practical aspects until much later, but its message is very clear here. Separate out life situations from life itself, and deal with situations in a practical manner, doing what you can, one step at a time. And if there are things that you want to change, there are only 3 sane options: 1. walk out if you can, 2. take steps to change it, focusing on what you can do now, or 3. if neither of the above two are possible, accept the situation totally, even if only temporarily. Acceptance itself is a doorway to peace... These teachings are helping me every single time my mind starts to complain or blame.The biggest lesson I learned is to use the mind only when it is necessary, and not follow every single thought that occurs in my mind. The exercise of awareness is the toughest one I have ever done in my life!I still experience mood swings. Unfulfilled desires from the past with respect to my profession keep springing up. (The mind's imagination here is very strong.) But I know, right now, I have to just live a regular life, as a householder, be with my family and continue my current job. My mind isn't stable enough for other pursuits now, since it's constantly changing, going in circles - one day it wants to go back to graduate school, get a PhD and become a professor, next day it wants to go to a tropical island and work as a waiter (getting away from all work that requires my brain), another day it says life is wonderful as it is and how much money I would lose if I went elsewhere... With Eckhart's help, I now know that all these are just narratives of the mind. I know what's practical for my life now and what I need to be doing every hour. Just focusing on that is enough. (Let the morrow take care of itself.)Like Eckhart recommends, I am using my situation as a strong motivation to practice Presence. In my case, the situation is not external; it is extremely close to me, since it is my own mind! The suffering I experience when the mind takes me away from the Now is too much to bear. I have no choice now but to practice Presence.My current practice is to just keep my attention on what I should be doing this moment, and keep checking where my attention is. If my attention has gone astray, I don't condemn myself; I just bring it back to the Now. I find that my job keeps me sufficiently present, but at other times, when mind is not needed, I need to practice this consciously. Due to the force of habit, I frequently fall trap to following useless thoughts, but I am slowly breaking out of that bad habit. I am becoming more aware of my internal state. I also engage myself in helping my son with school work, reading, doing stock investing, writing, spending some time on Facebook, and watching TV shows and movies occasionally. Whatever keeps my mind engaged, or keeps my attention in the present, are all working just fine.Along with this book, Eckhart's videos on YouTube have also brought my attention back to the teaching. The message is the same, but every time I hear it, it's fresh!I conclude with the Zen statement from the book: ""What, at this moment, is lacking?""

  Although this book has been a benefit to me compared to watching TV for 5 hours, it wasn’t a great book. Its a (mostly) good idea with poor execution.While I was reading I would often ask myself, “what is the point of this chapter?”Not only are his intentions not always clear, he doesn’t follow basic principles of persuasion. He makes a bold claim about “Slowing Down the Aging Process” using his techniques and then says “Is there any scientific evidence for this? Try it out and you will be the evidence.” OK, maybe he’s right, or maybe he’s blowing smoke.Another way he does a poor job of convincing a skeptic is by not providing any sort of counter argument. For instance, he says sacrificing the future for the present is a ‘dangerous mental illness’ and you shouldn’t do things as a means to an end. I think almost anyone who stops and thinks for a moment will disagree with that, whether it's right or wrong, and he doesn’t address why that appeals to most people and why they shouldn’t do it. He just calls them ‘unenlightened.’I don’t agree with everything in this book, and he didn’t change my mind on anything. Through my own personal experience, I’ve already learned it’s bad to sacrifice too much of the present for the future, to not dwell on the past too much, and that meditation can calm your mind. For people who haven’t come to those conclusions, and don’t need much convincing, this book could help them.What this book did for me was to remind myself to live more in the present, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend it to anyone over another book on this subject.

  I read about half the book until I just had to put it down because it just became incoherent. Yeah, I get it, mindfulness, being present, listening to the body, yadda yadda. But as someone who has suffered through depression and has had immense success from anti depressants, his condescending lecture about medications numbing turned me off immediately. And the whole schtick about him waking up out of nowhere with this amazing epiphany and turn his life 180 sounds like a load of quackery.

  I have been through a lot of books on self development, getting ahead in business, relationships, spirituality, etc. Each one of them has its merits and strengths. By far ""The Power of Now"" is the most profound teaching I have come across. It is easy to read and follow and at the same time incredibly profound, full of meaning and truth. This book definitely shows the path to awakening, peace and enlightenment! It is one of those books where ""drop everything you are doing and read this book"" applies.

  I very recently purchased this book and after only 11 pages into reading it, I am so ready for the journey that it is going to take me on. I believe that the author should not be held responsible for the readers level of comprehension in regards to the style of writing or the content.  I also believe that many of the people that gave this book a bad review don't understand where Tolle is trying to take them and may not be READY for this type of book. It is definitely based on where you are in your level of enlightenment .  Perhaps reading it later on when they have had more awakenings may be better for them. I love this book already and will be back for a second review once I complete it.

  I rarely ever write reviews for anything, even bad stuff, but this book is so poorly incoherent that I had to leave a review. The book is nothing more than a bunch of incoherent ramblings. I could barely finish the first chapter. I even gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried to skip to other parts of the book only to find the same rambling nonsense.

  This is the only book so far that I gave 99.9% of my consious attention. Not while driving, not while listening to music and not while doing anything else, other than reading it!Also, 95% of it I read with my eyes while following allong Ekhart's voice in the audio book version, to make sure that I'm as immersed into it as humanly possible.Countless insights, weird ""enlightment moments"" and a sense of ""finally nailing"" the missing part of my lifelong goal - to be free!This is by far the most exciting and amazing book experience I've had in my life.Thank you Ekhart Tolle and everyone that somehow contributed to the writing and publishing of this wonderful book.Yosi Ben Zvi

  I have done a good amount of spiritual exploration, including many books. This is one to enjoy, but was not something of potential lasting impact compared to others. Less impactful philosophical/ spiritual / religious works tell you the answers without telling you how to get there. For Toilet, he woke up one day with all of the answers. As we all know, one should beware instant enlightenment. This is why drugs don't work. Better, longer lasting evolution comes with a re-wiring of the brain over time. We are impressed by the logic of an argument, we ponder on it's merits, we internalize and it changes us. Someone telling you to ""be happy"" sounds impressive because this is the answer. But the feeling lasts only as long as the unchallenged repetition of such a mantra sustains. This is an ok book, but will not do much to change your mind. My guess is that Toile read a few aithors who had really done their work and parapgrased some conclusions .

  I did not finish this book, and instead started skimming chapters about 35% through and realized that it doesn't get any better, so I finally gave up at about 45%. While I appreciate the idea he was trying to get across, I personally feel other people do it much better through the practice of meditation. I found Tolle to be a very pretentious and arrogant narrator that made it very difficult for me to read his thoughts and ideas. Others love him and find use for these ideas - I just can't. I'll stick with meditation thank you.Feel free to try this book yourself though as you may have better luck.

  I enjoyed the first part of the book and there are some mind challenging concepts, definitely food for thought. The author references Buddhism and Taoism quite a lot, so if that's something you're interested in you will like this book. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it's very repetitive. After the first few chapters, where Tolle describes what is meant by living and being in the Now, the rest of the book is spent on addressing questions on how to do that. There are lots of references to Christianity and what Jesus said, but I found it very repetitive and, in my opinion, it could have been condensed. Don't let this deter you from reading it though, this is subject matter that philosophers debate and discuss and it is interesting material.

  I originally bought this book several months ago but after reading the Preface and Introduction was completely turned off with it.  So I donated it to a resale shop.  A couple of weeks later I decided I hadn't really given it a chance, so ordered another copy.  This time I skipped the Preface and Introduction and went straight into the body of the book.  I am very glad I did.This book has been helpful to me in so many ways both personally and in my relationships, casual ones and close ones.  The changes I want to make in myself, based on the insights of the author and on my own self assessments, are difficult in that I have to be constantly self aware as I work to change a lot of unhelpful habits developed over many years of living those habits.  The payoff, and what motivates me to continue working to develop new, helpful habits, is the positive effects that I see every day in a lot of ways - a significant improvement in how happy I am - big and small ways.Occasionally I talk to other people about concepts in the book and how they have helped me.  The result being that I have purchased several more copies for family and friends who say they would like a copy.This is one book that has truly helped me make significant, positive changes.

  I love this book and I re-read it regularly.  If you have negative thoughts, or if your self talk is constant (and negative), this book will help you identify what you are doing and give you techniques for stopping it.  This book, if taken to heart, can make your life better, more peaceful and without guilt, mental anguish, or negative thoughts.  It teaches you to be happy in the moment you are living and allows you to stop lingering in the past or trying to control the future.

  Reading Eckhart Tolle’s masterpiece changed my life for the better. I was depressed and feeling absolutely dreadful for almost a year after a devastating life event until a dear friend recommended this book to me. Even after the first chapter, I started to experience change in my life after a rather long period of emotional stagnation.  I got out of my own head and started living in the present. Today I am still on the journey of self awareness that began with this book, but I have a much greater appreciation for my surroundings and the world around me and I know that state of mind makes me a lot happier. I hope that this book can help guide you, the reader of this review, to lead a happier life as well!

  It's been over a year and a half since I read this book and bought the practice book which is just a summarized version: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1577311957/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1Be aware of what you feel and think, watch your thoughts, feelings, and actions.That is what I understood as the theme of the book, but it obviously goes into more depth. From what other people say, I can see where the nonsense and ramblings may be perceived.Here's a little about myself so you can understand who this is coming from:I try to take an observational approach inside and outside my life, exploring and tasting the abundance around me. I wouldn't label myself as a spiritual dude or hippie, I like improving myself and that includes my state of mind. That's not to say that I promote or walk around looking like a coachella concert smoking enlightenment all day, I am a guy who does guy stuff. I talk trash with my friends, I embrace all types of humor including dark humor and what have you. As one who loves life and its inhabitants, I still like to keep a healthy amount of skepticism (an open mind) to what I experience, including what I read or what is said.During my read I found that the author also realized many people would reject the way he thinks and so he even speaks about why one must keep an open mind. Any form of rejection such as judgement, spite, or complete distancing of a subject or situation can happen because the mind will reject anything not comfortable to what is unfamiliar. With my skepticism I still read on and true. There is a lot going on in this book that's easier said (and not understood) than done and can take time to absorb. What I can say to that is just get to the summarized version because that is a lot less wordy and just gets straight to the why you must practice presence and how to become present.The book has a lot to offer around his concept of presence, reality, and other experiences. Some may revel in beautiful harmony from this book, others will willingly move forward trying to practice it, testing the waters (which includes me), and others will just say no. All are fine because self-improvement is an investment, and this is a big one. To that though I would like to say that none of these reviews can really tell you what you need to know. The only experience worth living is the one that is being experienced and so I say to anyone and to you just read it, give it some attention, try it out. There was a quote that said, ""Don't be too busy building the ship that you never embrace the sea"" That is in my perspective, don't be too busy looking at these reviews and just experience it yourself!Overall, and so if you're also just a casual reader and would like a new perspective or practice to try, this is also it.Wish you all the best, fellow friends and coachello's

  I now notice that I have read Tolle's two main books in the wrong time order. This 'Now' is about ten years older than 'A New Earth', so here are the original thoughts. Of course, they can be read independently, and they both contain the same basic ideas, but they are not replaceable by each other. The New can be seen more like consequences of the Now, a building on the fundament of this older work. It is remarkable that the original work is still valid, a kind of proof of the firmness of the original ideas.To me it is the most fascinating idea that without me feeling to the least degree scitsofrenic I can think that there is two bodies of myself, or actually three: the physical and two spiritual bodies: the conscious mind and the real inner body.  'When thinking, the tyrant, the mind is ruling me, my real being' as Tolle says. Tolle's ideas, presented in this book, are a valuable guidance tothe recognition of the Real Me, my inner body.According to Tolle, the Real Me is not recognized by deep thinking, but on the opposite, by stopping it, surrendering to what is, what exists. Damn the past, do not worry of the future. There is no such thing as time. Time is just an illusion. All that really happens, does it right now. So the old wisdom of the two words 'carpe diem' - 'seize the day' is the kernel of Tolle's Now. - It is just astonishing that these word are not referred to in this book. It can well be, of course, that a day is too concrete and too long unit for Tolle, in fact a unit of time, which just is completely damned.If you are thinking any past ideas, then the mind, the conscious mindbody is using you. You are unconsciously identified with it, so you don’t even know that you are its slave. In stead you should try to reach the consciousness away from mind activity and create a gap of no-mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is the essence of meditation.Says Tolle: ""Ceasing to create pain in the present and dissolving past pain — this is what I want to talk about now. Here is the key: End the delusion of time. Time and mind are inseparable. Remove time from the mind and it stops — unless you choose to use it. Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now. Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in the Now.""When you remember the past, you reactivate a memory trace — and you do so now. The future is an imagined Now, a projection of the mind. When the future comes, it comes as the Now. When you think about the future, you do it now.Tolle's radical advice sounds: 'Find the ""narrow gate that leads to life."" It is called the Now. Die to the past every moment. You don't need it. Only refer to it when it is absolutely relevant to the present. Feel the power of this moment and the fullness of Being. Feel your presence.'Do not turn your attention elsewhere in your search for the Truth, for it is nowhere else to be found but within your body. 'Through the inner body, you are forever one with God' says Tolle.And how can you in concrete terms try to find your inner body and give more space to it? This is what Tolle says:""When you are unoccupied for a few minutes, and especially last thing at night before falling asleep and first thing in the morning before getting up, ""flood"" your body...""Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of yielding to rather than opposing the flow of life. However, do not confuse surrender with an attitude of ""I can't be bothered anymore"" or ""I just don't care anymore.""...In surrender, you no longer need ego defenses and false masks. Presence is the key. The Now is the key.

  This book feels like watered down advaita vendata. While reading it I had the sense that it was geared more towards ""pop culture"". As another reviewer pointed out, there are many problems in this book that the reader can relate to; but the solutions are few and far between. If you have surrendered and you recognize your mind energy, your various emotional frequencies, and the many esoteric concepts Tolle presents, then this book is for you. I have gained more insight through Paul Hedderman, Adyashanti, and Rupert Spira.I would be curious to know, of the 9,516 people that have purchased this book on Amazon, how many realized something they already had?

  I read, and listened to the audio CDs, ""The Power of NOW"" years ago. This reading allowed me to get a much deeper meaning to Mr. Tolle's words, and also helped me understand how God is helping all of us when we openly turn to Him with repentant hearts. Being reminded that we only have NOW to make the needed changes in our lives aided me to take the steps I needed to make. I also have a better understanding of the Bible, from the Old Testament through the New Testament, and see how Jesus spoke of being in the NOW so that we may better hear our Father's voice. I highly recommend this book to everyone who is seeking a closer walk with God.

  Thankfully I read A NEW EARTH before The Power of Now - so I had been introduced to some of Eckhart’s concepts - despite POWER being published first. Although beloved by millions, I read some negative reviews. These people will just never get it - maybe on their deathbed but probably not. It’s absolutely common sense but absolute wisdom in every word. Save yourself and your sanity by absorbing every word. I too needed to contemplate suicide before realizing I needed to learn acceptance - I am happier now and more in love with my being, my husband, than ever before. I lost my “fortune” but found myself. Thank you Elkhart for clarifying in words what in my heart and soul I had to learn for myself.

  Eckhart Tolle is an insightful and welcome respite from today’s painful realities. While not meant for every reader— he offers what amounts to a path leading away loss, death, loneliness, and the evil permeating today’s leadership. What it amounts to is an acceptance of your personal path and destiny — it is an ego-less realization of acceptance and change.  Hard science is not a part of his repertoire — so it devoid, at times, of physical measure. However, one does come away with a better self-knowledge: it provides the means to self-conceptualizing your place in an uncertain reality. Let go of the Ego and stand your ground!

  I mostly listen to the audio book version of this book which might make it easier to digest its meaning and get through some of the 'fluff'. I personally did not notice any of this fluff, it mostly resonated with me. I have attempted to give copies of this book to many people and mostly unsuccessful and reading some of these reviews back that up. My suspicion (and this is from my personal experience when my intimate relationship was breaking down and my partner was attempting to get me to read this book) is that either people are unable to comprehend its meaning or unwilling, as this text is a frontal assault on just about everything we thought we knew about ourselves. Anyone that truly understands this book experiences dissolving of identity, and some people are not ready for that. I usually tell people if they don't grasp the meaning and profoundness of the book within the first chapter, you probably wont at all. Personally, I broke down in tears at one of the first passages in the first chapter about the beggar and the gold in his box he'd been sitting on for years but never looked inside. I had already understood some of this books meaning deep inside to some degree, but the way Eckhart put his ideas, theories, and understanding down on paper instantly resonated with me and brought me in touch with myself to an extremely deep level.A note to people that end up loving this book:I 'study' this book all the time by repeatedly listening to the audio book version because its easy to forget some of the important stuff. Also, the next book ""A New Earth"" is a must read! It answers a lot of the questions about how to put his teachings into practice.Remember, the now is all you ever have.

  Mr. Tolle spent two years sitting on park benches and simply ""living in the moment"" prior to writing this book. I doubt whether I will ever take the time in my life to do such a thing, however the suggestion he offers that we all spend a ridiculous amount of time either worrying about the future, or dwelling on the past has impacted me in a huge way. Until I read this book, I never noticed how insane my mind can make me if I choose to let it. Tolle implores the reader to take the reigns of his own mind, focus on the beauty and love around him, just like we all did when we were children and the world was full of wonder. We are still in that same world, but our vision has been clouded by meetings, appointments, paperwork, debt, clocks ticking, deadlines approaching, past frustrations and disappointments, the list goes on and on and on if you let it. Tolle suggest that we have the power to focus on this very moment, as it is the only one we really have. The past is past and the future is not here, and may not ever come. A very enlightening book. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to improve the quality of this moment of their life.

  It is important to understand that unless you're fully prepared to make positive changes in your life (which may not be easy, but tremendously beneficial in the long run) with an open heart & are ready to be completely honest with yourself then this isn't the book for you. I noticed that the majority of the reviews are 5/5 or 1/5 & I'd guess the majority really depended on whether or not the reader was open & ready to read this book, because if you're not you won't even understand it & likely won't last for more than a chapter or 2. This book has helped change my life in a very positive way more than any other book I have ever read. It has helped me remove my ego & become a more caring, loving & selfless person.

  As others have stated... this book flows fairly well and the ideas and exercises in it are good. Up until about half way through. Then it starts to get repetitive and the ideas more and more abstract. It starts to become very difficult for one to follow and actually understand. Its one thing to read but another to read and comprehend the ideas.I felt it was almost a chore to finish this book (I am 20 pages away from finishing). There are some very short parts (as in a few pages) where it gets good again towards the last couple chapters (after the chapter about relationships) but again mixed in with hard to comprehend ideas. In my opinion it could've been made into less than 100 pages.Who knows though, maybe I'll come back in 5-10 years and give it another read and pick up on things I glossed over the 1st read. I am highlighting, taking notes, and really trying my hardest to make the most of of this book but I think some of the reviews are a little ""generous"" with the rating.

  I had heard of this book through a YouTuber I watch, and forgot about it. I then joined her first workbook program, and there were several others who had read this as well, and I couldn't help but to finally make this a part of my reads for this year. I took this full month to read it (April 2017) and it has been the greatest spiritual based book I've read. For a 22 year old, who was partially raised in the church (my first part of childhood wasn't going to church but for about 5 years, till I was 16, I was made to attend church), this pointed out and worded perfectly how I feel about religion, and pointed me in the direction that I need. I will definitely keep this in my library to read again, as I know this will be a staple in my life now. I suggested this as a read for my father (a pastor's son, who is a psychologist), and feel as though he will benefit so much from this as well in his spiritual walk. This is one of those books where you'll come back to it as you grow in your journey of now. If you're hesitating to read this,  don't do like I did and wait. Just buy and read it. Take the moment and meditate when something strikes your soul in this, along with the breaks he puts in. The only moment you really have is now.

There's lots of ways to do the work, but we are all responsible for finding what is best for us.I did find Tolle to sometimes be vague only to address the issue more fully several pages later.  He mostly mixes Christian mysticism with Buddhism.  I think it's a good mix, and it has worked well for me, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea.

  06/03/20:The philosophy of this book is about not engaging in life. It has many characteristics of Eastern philosophies in which the main point is to avoid suffering. The problem is in order to avoid suffering, you must avoid engaging in life, and people, completely. The book demonizes the ego, but without an ego communication/interaction is impossible. There is not a universal/fundamental/conscious answer in communicating with another person, it is up to one's ego.In the analogy of life as a ""game"", this philosophy would be 'not playing'. In other words, ""I can't lose, if I don't play.""This philosophy basically involves committing mental suicide. Once your mind/ego is dead, there is no more suffering; kinda like the philosophical equivalent to a lobotomy. In complete detachment (ego death) you can no longer be hurt as there is no more ""you"". This is when you just ""are"". You are completely carefree, with no attachments, or responsibilities.I think philosophies of detachment and ""you are not your thoughts"" are very helpful in times of extreme stress and suffering. It is very useful to sometimes separate your consciousness from your thoughts/emotions. But to throw away your desires/motivation/mind/identity/life to avoid suffering is a bit extreme imo.I gave this book 4 stars cus i'm not saying the philosophy doesn't work. It absolutely does work in avoiding suffering, but it comes at the price of ""your life."" If you take this philosophy to heart ""you"" should not have a life anymore, you should just exist in carefree, joy.__________________________________/////EDIT (11/25/20): *5 stars/////I recently started re-reading this book and I can't believe how misguided I was the first time around. I can't go into all the details so I'll sum it up.The biggest reason I rejected the ideas in this book was because I hadn't answered the most important question: ""what is the meaning of life?"" It might sound like a joke but in order to mentally digest this book you need to read it from an absolutely fundamental perspective.If you are reading this book and disagree with it's philosophy (as I did). Ask yourself, what is the meaning of life? What do you truly want? If you are hellbent on success/achievement/prestige (as I was), or fame/power/wealth/etc. ask yourself, why do you want these things? Who is ""success"" for?I can give you the answers to these questions but I don't think I or anyone can really make you believe/understand, unless you arrive at them on your own.I think it's important to analyze and reflect on life/reality fundamentally, before reading this book or else things like the separation of self from the idea-of-self will just sound like a bunch of mumbo jumbo.P.S. I realize there are many misguided/ignorant thoughts in my first review. I like to keep it as a humbling reminder.

  Wow this book has completely changed the course of my life because it has completely and permanently changed me. I have never felt so alive so present so peaceful and yet so powerful in my entire life. I can feel A glow inside and around me ever since I started practicing the power of now. To my Pleasant surprise my husband gave me the best compliment ever without even knowing how amazing I was feeling inside. He stopped me as I was walking past him and told me how beautiful I was and then paused and so genuinely said to me that there’s a glow about me, he then joked and asked if I was pregnant which I am definitely not. It felt magical to witness being the evidence of this book to confirm the what I am feeling on the inside is obviously visible/radiating on the outside. Wow!! If you’re ready for change and you’re ready to experience something you’ve never experienced before then don’t hesitate and buy the book. The negative reviews are normal because  not everyone that buys the book will be ready to drop their egoic mind because it has deeply defined them their entire life (including myself) Reading and accepting this book can be a battle but certainly one that we all have the power to win and that is most definitely worth fighting for. Once you win you will  finally feel complete, feel whole,  feel peace without the need of anyone or anything in this world to complete you other then your attention on the power of now!

  I like The Power of now,  you'll be knowing your about your self and others better when you read this book.The way Eckhart simplify his word in order for every reader can get the meaning of some terms like the Ego, Pain body and other psychological terms and how it functioning is amazing, besides the technique you'll learn of how to stop unwanted compulsive thoughts which most of the time is unconscious kind of thoughts, this is amazing.I already bought the paper copy of this book, it's always beside my bed.

  I read this book @ 20 years ago and it was good then.  I also bought ""PRACTICING THE POWER OF NOW"" and ""STILLNESS SPEAKS.""  Having read the main title again, I think I would advise people to dip their toes in a little more directly, by purchasing one of the latter two books.  There is no cover-up that they all basically contain the same ideas and material.  It's just a bit easier to digest for today's readers, I feel.  The first 40-50 pages of this main book can be somewhat hard to get through....especially if you're quite ""unconscious.""  It truly will sound the ego-tended "" useless FLUFF"" alarms off.  I recommend sticking with it all the way through...it's not that long a book.  Better yet, start off with the latter two books mentioned above and if you're up to the task or more interested, read this, the original book.

  I was two weeks into a painful breakup and someone suggested this book to me as the ""only thing that got me through my last terrible breakup"", so I bought it that evening and started it. I woke up very early the next morning (I was sleeping horribly) and read some more. It made an immediate difference for me. Practicing turning off my thinking (sadness about the past and terrific anxiety about the future) grounded me a lot that day and was a turning point in my breakup pain. It was kind of unbelievable that it had such a dramatic effect so fast, but I was in so much pain that this book really spoke to me and I was ready for and receptive to its message. I told people that the book basically gave me permission to stop thinking. I stopped trying to fix my problem (of feeling bereft after being left after 10 years)  by thinking it through and organizing my next moves so that I'd feel more secure. I actually let go of a lot of my fear and that allowed me to make some constructive and daring moves that I would otherwise not have done. I can imagine that it won't change everyone's life upon reading it, but it sure impacted me because of when I read it.

  There are SO few books I would consider to have changed my life -but this is one of them. That being said - I have gifted this book to several friends who found Eckhart's message or style hard to understand. So, you have to be ready for this message in order to be receptive. It definitely helps if you have watched some of his videos and get to  know the person who is speaking. This book is full of wonderful ways to live your life more peacefully. It describes how to be less reactive, how to understand and forgive people who behave ""unconsciously."" It addresses how to remove judgement from people and situations; as in how quickly we ""label things as good and bad,"" ETC.  I also feel like I appreciate nature more and the simple everyday tasks that I used to take for granted. Thank you, Eckhart!

  Kind of a strange book. But at times my brain keeps thinking about things and that stops me from being present. So the book helped me to stop doing that or at least to catch myself and bring myself back into the here and now. I try a little meditation and it is hard for me to just let go of thoughts ... they keep intruding. The book says to look for The Watcher. I would like to know how you find that entity. Is it situated in a part of the skull? At any rate, I read the book and highlighted the passages I thought were appropriate for me. And now I now and then read over what I highlighted.

  The power of now expresses that ruminating needlessly about your past or worrying about your future wastes spiritual and psychological energy...it wastes your life.  The author Eckhart Tolle genuinely lives the power of now, which greatly increases credibility of the book.  If you want to understand how to reduce pain and suffering in your life, this is a great book.  It leads to a better understanding of yourself and others and clears up questions like why do people think I'm a jerk and why is everyone else a jerk?His book A New Earth is also very good and furthers living in the present.

  10 years ago when I picked up this book, I was in the middle of a severe health crisis. I thought I was going to die because no one could figure out what was happening to me. Fearing the worst, and riddled with anxiety I started reading. By page 40, I had a huge awakening about myself. I had always been an anxious person and I thought it was just how I was, but Eckhart Tolle explained exactly why I had been anxious and what the feeling truly was - it wasn’t “just a part of me” but an unrecognized attempt to cope with a future scenario. And, as he pointed out, you cannot cope with anything that isn’t happening NOW. It’s simply impossible. All my life I was planning for the worst, attempting to deal with whatever life would throw my way. Always  preparing mentally. Never had it occurred to me that I simply had a habit of thinking in the future and just needed to embrace the moment I was in, no matter what that moment contained. There can never be peace in the future. Peace only resides in the now.The awakenings didn’t stop there. I realized many other things about myself - why I felt a certain way (usually depressed,) why I was attracted to certain people, and why I never felt like I was as good as others.I may be Eckhart Tolle’s number one fan.I have recommended his book to every person I know at least four or five times. I’m a relationship and dating coach and I recommended it to all my clients. The only issue that some people run into is that it’s a tougher read, as other reviews have mentioned, so you have to really want to understand it. I ended up writing and publishing a book based on these teachings for my clients in more layman’s  language because I got tired of having to hold study sessions. But without this book, I know that I am a completely different person today than I was 10 years ago. I have Eckhart Tolle to thank for curing my anxiousness, building a successful business and having a healthy marriage. He’s my hero. I hope one day I get to meet him and shake his hand (if were still doing that by then!)

  I have purchased many items on Amazon and I rarely post a review, but I felt very compelled to post one based off of how this book has impacted me.  The book essentially put into words and description the years of uneasiness, anxiety and restlessness I have felt along with low grade depression.  It made me realize that this is essentially a fabrication of my mind, and that being resentful or angry about the past and anxious about the nonexistent future is what causes this feeling.  By focusing on the moment, there is nothing to be concerned about and the mind is quiet and at peace.  This is really the biggest takeaway I have from the book.  Another takeaway is that people will search their whole lives for happiness in money, material items, their job and other basically meaningless things but will never find it because this search is fruitless.  Peace is internal and can only be found by focusing on the now and what you are doing in the moment.  Since reading this book I have feel this great sense of peace and calmness on a daily basis.  I think everyone on Earth should read this book, especially with everything that is going on in the world right now.

  I bought this book because it was quoted in a video.  Apparently, taking things out of context can work in a sources favor too!  Who knew?Its pseudoscience ramblings.  The goal of the booth seems to be to tell you to stop thinking.  I think maybe he was trying to suggest meditation in a less direct way, but all the flowery overly complex nebulus words with either seemingly no purpose or most likely chosen to hide a lack of knowledge distract from the message.  ""Stop thinking, to be happy"", now spend a lot of time thinking about and decoding what I am purposefully making complex when I say it.

  I really wanted to like this book.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get through the whole thing.  I tried!  It was as dry as an unsalted Saltine cracker without an iota of levity.  It seems that when he lost his egoic mind that fateful day, he also lost his humor.To be fair, there are a couple of little nuggets of wisdom I was able to take away from this book.  I do like that idea that we think too much about the past and future.  But unless you've been fortunate enough to lose your egoic mind I find it nearly impossible to maintain my thoughts to NOW for more than a handful of seconds (and I meditate twice a day, every day).  We're just not built that way.  We have minds to remember, to plan, foresee, evaluate, and reminisce.  I mean... try it yourself!  See how long you can go only thinking about NOW.  It's a nice thought (ha!), but as far as I'm concerned, almost impossible.The other small diamond I gleaned from this book is that we are not our thoughts.  This could be a huge revelation for some people.  Just because you think it does not make it so. We tell ourselves we're depressed, lonely, fat, broke, etc... and because we think it, sometimes all day, every day, then it must be true!  The evil ego makes us believe that our thoughts make up who we really are and that's its way of maintaining control over us.See, the antagonist in this book is the ego.  It's the cause of all of our problems, personally and as a species.  Tolle believes that if humans are not able to get control of our thinking, the ego is going to take us all down.  He believes we are on the precipitous of complete ruin because the egoic mind has been able to run amok convincing everyone that we are separate from one another, only out for ourselves, and that the future of all mankind rests in the balance.  So... who knows?  If that's true, how do you get 7.5 billion people to listen to Tolle about focusing on the NOW?  We just might be doomed.This book is a dry, humorless collection of questions and answers from a seminar he had (quick way to pull in several million bucks). Tolle seems like a nice enough person but he comes across as cold and boring.  He said his enlightened consciousness happened overnight while he was sleeping. A more likely scenario is that he had an undiagnosed stroke that permanently tweaked his brain, obliterated his ego and humor, and then called it enlightenment.  We should all be so lucky!

  This is THE go to book for self-awareness and clarity. If you suffer from anxiety, this book is a must read. It explains how your mind works, and how we as a society are actually addicted to thinking. Our minds never get a break, and Tolle teaches us how to turn it off and how to use the tool that is our mind, rather than having it use us.  Now, with the advent of social media and smart phones, it is even more relevant. Being fully in the moment is the key to enjoying life, yet it is getting farther and farther from our grasp in this crazy, stressed, rushed society we live in, where Christmas begins in our stores the day after Halloween and we are always forced to be thinking about tomorrow rather than today.

  I didn't find it to be anything too profound, though certainly beneficial. It seemed to be a bit repetitive, and often times saying the same thing over and over again but in a slightly different way. The central message to The Power of Now is simple... live in the present moment. Don't dwell in the past and don't dwell in the future. And, when you can train your mind to stay in the present... you have achieved consciousness (or enlightenment). Obviously, this isn't a simple thing to achieve since the mind has a natural tendency to be always thinking. And, Tolle provides some practical ways to practice and develop the habit of living in the present moment. Unfortunately, it took 229 pages to tell us all of this. Nevertheless, it's a decent book and has provided a doorstep into the practice of mindfulness for me.

  I would say ""if you had never experienced truly being in the present moment..."" but the truth is, you almost certainly have before. As a child you probably had many of these experiences. Times when your mind was completely void of thought, and you sort of just... were. Actually taking time to ""stop and smell the roses."" Eckhart Tolle does an amazing job of leading you back to a state of mind that should be natural to you. He reminds you how to worry less and be more stress free by being ""in the moment."" When I begin to feel stress in my body, I remember exactly what this book explains in order to feel lighter. Enlightened.

  I’m 29 and I just have to say this is the best book I’ve ever read. I just happened to start reading this book just weeks before my 29th birthday actually. Ironically enough, on the first page Eckhart starts off with “one night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday...”I’ve been through depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, dealt with undiagnosed adhd all the way up through my 20s and only diagnosed after college, I’ve been through abusive relationships, have become toxic myself in following relationships, have been through ptsd because abuse, have never met my own dad and have dealt with an unstable family life my whole life... basically I felt absolutely lost nearing my 30s and most of the time hopeless. My main emotions were anger and fear. I felt them constantly for as long as I can remember. They overcame me quite often and was exhausting and detrimental to everything in my life. It was holding me back from my true potential and I wallowed in self pity and being a victim. I’ve tried an antidepressant and it only works to an extent, but it doesn’t help change your outlook and detach from your pain. This book has changed my life and has helped me through my own awakening and detaching from my own pain body. It’s truly helped bring me to enlightenment. So, to address the people who are giving this book a one star... all I can say is that these people are still asleep or they have not gone through what they need to go through to understand Tolle’s words. They are in simple terms just not awake.I can’t tell you how many times I read parts of this book and just thought holy crap, I GET it. It’s amazing. I never open this book and put it down without having new revelations. Not only has it brought enlightenment, but it’s also brought me closer to God and understanding of the universal as a whole (I guess that’s what enlightenment is though lol). I think it’s awesome as a Christian that Tolle has implemented God in such a delicate and tactful way. It’s not in an idolizing way and never once undermining Him either. Much respect there.It touches on so many things that we never have answers to or even think of asking these questions and brings about an explanation that just gives so much peace to your mind. It shuts it up and lets you really live in the now and to stop worrying.Just an example, but this week I’ve been dealing with pms and I was struggling a bit with being irritable and snappy. It always happens exactly a week before my period starts and I picked my book up today to read before bed and coincidentally I had been reading through chapter 8 and Tolle just happened to touch on the pain-body and when women deal with pms. It gives tips on how to stay on top of these reactions and to be aware of them, so that you can remain in your consciousness. He also mentioned how a partner can help you stay conscious when this pain body tries take over. I know I’ve dealt with this and my recent ex noticed it as well and always tried to help me through it when he picked up on my cycle, as I’m sure most men have recognized their girlfriend/wife go through. I think it’s awesome that Tolle explained how a partner can help their love through that week.Overall, just get this book if you’re on your spiritual journey. Well.. we all are, but if you’re awakening and looking for some guidance it’s well worth the read! I’m actually tapering off my antidepressant this week, that I’ve been on for a year and a half,  and I can say I feel strong enough now and this book is a nice comfort to have during this time.

  There are life changing insights and practices in this book. Specifically the relationship between attention and presence has helped me to leave behind a handful of very painful memories. The power of presence has also transformed my business and my relationships. I give the 4 stars instead of the 5 because in every time I've read this book I've come to a place later in the reading where it is difficult to maintain momentum in reading. That's probably more of an indication of my own state than that of the book.

  Good read and positive perspective. Encouragement and insightful, written from a viewpoint that was helpful. As a Christian, there are some correlations with Christianity, but is written from more of a Buddhist perspective, on a focus of peace and accepting of things that we cannot change, while resting in peace of knowing that our gifts are in the present moments of life. I enjoyed this book, even though some parts I generally didn’t agree with, it was beneficial for me to focus on this perspective.

  A girl I was fond of recommended me this book. She pointed out something pretty profound from the first three pages that she said stuck with her. I'll spoil it right here. He makes the point that if you ""can't live with yourself"" then there have two be ""two yous"" and ""only one of them is real.Literally everything past that point is just him straw-manning against a person that doesn't exist.

  There are some well laid out and inspiring concepts in this book. Step one is to realize that you are not your mind. You are the one who observes thoughts and emotions that come and go. Basically this means separating the Ego from the whole of your identity. When you overly identify with the mind or Ego as most of us do, you are led in all sorts of undesirable directions as the reasoning mind tries to make sense out of what is seen on the outside. The outer world of the five senses is all the Ego knows. It does not know the spiritual aspects of reality until it has been trained to accept them. In my eyes the Ego and the Bibles representation of the Devil are one in the same. Although I do not believe that the Devil is real in the way that the bible teaches but more of a psychological boundary.  The suffering that we all encounter is the result of an unchecked Ego when left to its own resources. Without the inner guidance that the spirit provides the Ego will run away with itself into compulsive patterns of ""sinful"" behavior.I liked this book because because of the way its laid out in an easy to digest way. However it is quite incomplete in my opinion to my go to book series. The Seth Books by Jane Roberts

  This book is a little hard to follow at first but I had to buy it after my dad recommended it for years. As someone who has been in therapy for close to six years and suffers from just about crippling anxiety, depression, and OCD I can say that this book has some wonderful and helpful ideas. It's easy to go back to and just read a little bit more whenever you need a pick-me-up.

I thought this book was so bad I actually feel a moral obligation to warn you against buying it! I remember someone saying ""the fact that no-one understands you doesn't make you an artist"".  This book is a bit like looking at cracked plate in the Tate gallery and someone of supposed intelligence telling you its ""art"" and implying you must be on a lower mental field if you don't get it.  This book is so spaced out and away with the fairies its hard to know where to begin: the review would be too long! Ok, there was the occasional flash of something inspirational or meaningful, but it didn't compensate for the enormous amount of drivel.

  So let’s be completely honest, the book is amazing. It highlights many important teachings on how to maneuver our perception of pain and pleasure and what stages we can engage in, in order to profoundly emerge ourselves in the Now. One of the biggest teachings I got was engaging in the present. Allowing myself to fully emerge in what is instead of what should be thus giving me the satisfaction of enjoying the moment and basking in the presence of gratefulness.Problem is, It’s relatable but only to a certain extent. In order to fully take in and receive the the message entirely, one must fully immerse and “surrender” any thought as to why and how. I understand the author did the most to convince the reader of a profound sense of self through examples and visualizations but it still lacked some sort of credibility. I guess that would explain and confirm that a portion of my perception is still manipulated with the mind instead of Being. But something in me finds it hard to relinquish any other intellectual offering presented by other great spiritualists, and take this full on. It gave me a bit of “drink this punch, no questions asked” vibe.I also found it extremely unpleasant bringing other great philosophers and twisting their viewpoints to further this ideology. I understand the author has his own perspectives on what is, but, respectfully should not bring other prophets words and state “facts” that that’s what they meant when the only people who know or even understand what those words mean are the ones who said it and the ones who heard it. Anything other than that are just interpretations and should be very careful with saying “this is what they meant”. Sounds a little Jim Jones to me.Anyways, for what it’s worth it was a great reading which made me realize that I should lessen my ego, listen to presence, engage in my present moment, and enjoy the process of living. Anything after that was just weird and repetitive and should be taken with a grain of salt.

  If you read one book this year - make it this one.  I've never been a believer in the 'spiritual hocus pocus' and was pretty skeptical when I made the purchase, but I gave it a chance... and it has changed my life.Learning to live in the present is incredibly powerful in so many ways.  8 months after reading the book, several concepts have been incorporated into my daily life.  Every day I enjoy reduced stress/anxiety, improved focus and performance, enriched relationships, positive outlook, incredible happiness and gratitude.  Nothing in my life has significantly changed, just the way I control my thoughts and ego.  The book also helped me differentiate spirituality from religion, which has been more fulfilling than I expected as I haven't actively practiced religion as an adult.I could write a book on how much I like this book (clearly), but I'll get all 'deep thought' on you and hope you'll consider this: we have such a short time on this earth, would you be willing to give these concepts a chance for even the possibility that every single day could be more rewarding for the rest of your life?

  Riddled with anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts after the break up of my marriage  I sort out meditation and yoga groups which gave me temporary serenity from this insanity.I came across this book a little over 10 years ago, whilst doing one of the breathing exercises I had my first glimpse of shutting up that annoying voice inside my head, the one that labels, condemns, calls names, you know those ""mind loops"" as I call them........its kind of like those cartoons with the angel and devil on your shoulders.Suddenly I saw that I am not that voice but I am the presence behind it, my first satori and the seed was planted.Ten years down the line and many people whom I know personally have had their lives changed for the better by this book.I suggest getting the audio version as well as or instead of the book version, I think it is easier to digest.During the period of digesting the book I highly recommend looking up ""Body Scan Meditation"" on youtube and trying out a 15 or so minute session a few times a week, its great to do before you sleep and/or when you wake up, its highly relaxing and will really help you quieten your inner voice and get you closer to that place of awakened peace.It takes time and it wont happen overnight, be present with everything you do at home and slowly you will bring that with you into the world.

  This has been an absolutely life-changing book for me. To write about what is contained in the book (in the past, of course!) almost seems sacrilegious after reading this. However, a few points really merit mentioning. First, Eckhart's ""no-nonsense"" writing style really helps make his case. He repeats the same points numerous times, with various explanations and different wording each time. However, instead of being a detractor, such a writing style really helps drill his points into the reader's head. Ever since putting it down, I find it difficult to stop thinking about focusing on the present moment and have really begun to take more control of the thoughts running through my mind. This book has helped me be more positive and more grateful for what exists right around me *now.* I bet it will do the same for you, if you truly soak up Eckhart's knowledge and boundless wisdom.

I did not agree with all of it, but at least half and most importantly the main point.

  This is a book that kept going out of our lending library and coming back and then going out again.  It didn't look like anyone read the whole book because the pages were only bent back for the first 50 or so pages.  This is a book that will challenge you to go on, simple almost stupid in parts.  The author says in the beginning chapters that he repeats himself a lot, so the message sinks in.  This is the first and only time I have gotten a believable answer to the question ""Why do people risk their lives to climb mountains that they know can kill them.""  As a younger man I use to storm sail on the bay in a small boat and I never know why a group of us could never get enough of the thrill of total disaster.  Although death was extremely unlikely, broken masts, stays and a possible bad bruise where not.  It answered in very simple terms why some people do what they do and why you should try to live in that zone, or recapture it if you once did.  The pleasure, joy and meaning it brings to life (and death) is worth the experience.  And you can achieve the same result in daily activates that involve no risk or harm to yourself or others.  The part of sleep I still haven't been able to master, but I am hoping one day I will.  You hear from time to time teachers being able to take 15 minute naps between classes and wake up refreshed.  Same principles apply, but I can't seem to reach any where near that point.

If this book doesn't trigger a huge epiphany for you, then you might not be looking into yourself deep enough.

  Firstly, I would like to say that if you were to purchase The Power of Now, I would recommend buying the audio, and not the book. It is a lot easier to understand if you hear the author talk about it, rather than if you try to read it and to make sense of it, even though the audio and the book are of the same content.Next, I would like to say that this book is not for everyone. When I first started listening to it, some of the things the author talked about rung true with me because of things that had happened to me in my life, while other things I looked at with extreme skepticism and ridicule to the point where I discarded these teachings as nonsense. If you have never studied anything spiritual, and have never had any first had experiences with such issues, then you will have a hard time understanding what the author is talking about.That said, I have concluded from connecting the ideas in this book to those from a variety of other books, and from my own personal experiences, that what the author is speaking of is certainly true. There are many reviewers who claim Eckhart Tolle is a thief and a fraud because he keeps repeating the same idea over again and because there is nothing in this book which can't be found anywhere else. It is true that there is nothing new here, but he openly admits it in the book. He says that this book is the one true spiritual teaching which can be found in all the world's religions. Yes, with all the hate and strife that religion is causing us, it is difficult to believe that all the world's religions contain the same message of love. I had a hard time believing it myself, but it is the truth. What the author has done is he has collected the esoteric teachings and put them in words which the layman could understand, so instead of reading the ancient Hindu and Buddhist texts which are rife with symbolism, you can read this book where all the symbols are deciphered.You might not be ready to read this book today. You might not be ready to read it in a year, but there will come a day when you are ready to take in what the author has to say and you will know the truth without a doubt.(ADDED CONTENT BELOW MONTHS AFTER WRITING ORIGINAL REVIEW)There is one thing I would like to advise people new to the subject of Eastern practices. You may get the impression from this and many similar books that life is meaningless, bleak, and that the only way to be happy is to lose any amibition you have to accomplish anything. This is not the case, and you will only see this when you've immersed yourself with this practice and developed a higher level of mental ability. Once you're there, you will be able to accomplish whatever you want because you are no longer afraid of failing. You won't get upset when you strum the wrong string; on the contrary, you will embrace the mistakes and realize that they are all part of the learning experience of life.I used to be very driven when I was younger, but when I started getting involved in Eastern spirituality, I lost most of my fire because I realized that my life would ultimately end. It's one thing to think about it, but when you realize it deeply, it shakes you to the core. I no longer strived to reach the heights of the world because I didn't feel there was a point. However, slowly but surely, the drive that once characterized my personality returned with avengence, and I have become more ambitious than I have ever been. I am in the constant process of improving myself through reading (non-fiction, vocabulary building, writing style, self improvement), meditating, lifting heavy weights, stretching, and I've taken up guitar playing. I want to become the best at it, but I am doing it for myself. I am no longer driven by an obsessive need to be seen as the best by others, the need that subtly haunted me during my basketball days.My main advice to you is to be patient with this practice. There may be a hopeless transition period where you are breaking down the barriers of sludge that have cut you off from who you were always supposed to be, but once they are down, it be more than worthwhile.

  I enjoyed the views of the author.  He brought an alternative idea of what the higher spiritual power is in my life and it resonates.  My favorite statement is when he says “be the light”.  Thanks Eckhart, you’ve added to my enlightened state and allowed me to realize that much more consciousness.

  I purchased this book for my 26 year old niece.  I told her to read it now, in five years, in another five years, and so on.  I told her that you will get something out of it now, but the more you read it, the more you get out of it.  Then in five years, read it again, and see if you were able to apply it to your life.  Then again in five years.  I'm in my mid-forties and I'm just now able to apply it.  I hope it doesn't take her that long.This book shows you how to simplify your life.  It's easy as staying in the present moment.  Easy...right, not so much, but Eckhart shows you how.  This book will help anyone of any age, but it takes practice and patience.  It works though.

  Are you going through a tough time? This book helps me put everything into perspective and focus on the good things when life throws you a curve ball. The only thing you truly have control over is yourself! So focus on YOU when the going gets tough and don't give up! I would also like to note that I have been reading various zen books and this seems to teach a similar mindset without all the ""our body and mind are not two and not one"" type zen writings lol. 5 stars would def recommend!

  If you're ready to face the truth about religion, ego, self loathing, trying to be something you're not, this may be the book you need to read. Not easy reading because it's NOT about the ""head"" or ""brain"" it's about finding your authentic self and living in the ""now"". Bringing past failures, resentment, pain into the present and dwelling upon those negative aspects of your life only hinder the healing that is available through delving into a deeper spiritual level that can free you from pain. Not a book to be read on ""how"" to gain more information, or knowledge. You have all you need, you just to need to know how to access that part of your spiritual being and live.This may sound like double talk, but once you begin the journey of finding your true, authentic self through consciousness it will make more sense to you than all the external gymnastics most religion require in order to find God. God is ever present, always there, but our ego centered mind, doesn't like living in the present it wants to be preoccupied with the painful past, or projecting unrealistic anxiety into the future.Begin where you're at and go from there. That's where The Power of Now, can help you become ""aware"", conscious and alive. It's not about believing any prescribed theology, it's about living and knowing who and what you are meant to become.

  As I've mentioned to family members and friends: ""I wish I had heard of and read this book in 1999 when I graduated high school, read it again in 2003 upon graduating college, read it in my late 20's after experiencing many years in the ""real world"", and again now in my early 30's"". In short, it's a read people should absolutely give time & attention to, and then revisit at different stages of life.All that said, I'm very fortunate to have had the opportunity to read this book in any event and at this point in my life. I assure you The Power of Now has completely, 100% changed my outlook on life and eventual death.I've heard Eckhart Tolle speak on a podcast as well, and not only in this book but also speaking does a wonderful job of providing examples in which we as people in all shapes, geographies, situations (...overly-busy, overly-stressed, overly-connected, on the go, discouraged, hopeful, in search of the next 'thing', happy, scared....choose your life scenarios) help us to simply STOP and focus on the here and now. It sounds so obvious and so easy to comprehend, but he very much challenges you in your thinking and how you process life and life going on around you in every minute.I would 100% recommend anyone read this. I tend to take my time while reading books - I read the first 30-35 pages over two or three days, then read the entire rest of the book on a flight to and from AZ. Just couldn't put it down.

  Why do we all feel that something is missing?  We feel discontent, unworthy, anxious, depressed, ashamed, and sometimes plain bored.  Why do we suffer in these ways, and what can we do about it?  Strangely enough, this small book holds the answers.  It is a well-drawn map to freedom.I have read it four times, and each time it resonates as deeply as if I had written it myself - for me.  I have also read many other similar books from the “self-help” shelf, but none of them do what this book does.  Each reading, I understand more fully, and I walk away challenged to embody the lesson.  Each time I become … more.  This book transformed my life.Critics of this book claim it is full of “New Age,” woo-woo cliches.  They’re right, in a way, although fear not: you will find no mention of crystals, astrology, or spirits here.  The eclecticism and self-spirituality of the New Age movement inspired many to comb through world religions, mystic teachings, depth psychology, and philosophy to dig up gems of wisdom and free them of their dogma.  I view this book as the culmination of their work.  The result is a practical application of mysticism, drawn heavily from Zen, Advaita Vedanta, Sufism, and Gnosticism.  Tolle compares his teachings most closely with those of Ramana Maharshi and Jiddu Krishnamurti, but what he delivers is uniquely authentic, insightful, and profound.We are not our mind.  We are not our past.  At our core, we are the “One Life from which all that exists derives its being.”  We are the Source.  All of our problems and most of our suffering stems from misplaced identification with the ego, our conditioned mental self-image, and the “pain-body,” the ego’s dark shadow of remembered pain.  There are various methods we can use to shed this delusion: be intensely present in the Now, surrender full to what is, witness our thoughts to disidentify from the mind, and focus on the energy field of the “inner body.”  In fact, to accomplish any of these tasks is to accomplish them all.  And when we do, we experience stillness, peace, joy, love, and more.”Imagine a ray of sunlight that has forgotten it is an inseparable part of the sun and deludes itself into believing it has to fight for survival and create and cling to an identity other than the sun.  Would the death of this delusion not be incredibly liberating?””When you are transformed, your whole world is transformed, because the world is only a reflection.”

  I bought this book after listening to Jay Shetty and how he said he has read this book a few times. I must admit that it is deep. I had to reread many parts of this book. However, I felt that it really helped me examine how I react, to look at the why, and to appreciate the now.  There is more than just accepting a thought and reacting to it. Like why, why am I the way I am. And then how can I be better. And believe me, I had to dig deep and also note that I am a Christian. I say that to say that I believe that some things or books push me further away from my belief and I don’t read them any further.  This book however pushed me further to Who made me and who I am created to be. Just all around I would recommend, but give it time and be open to it.

  Possibly the best book I have ever read.  I read quite a bit.  I was a philosophy minor in college, took graduate level courses, then graduated from law school and worked a bit in politics. Nothing written in established academia compares to this straightforward presentation of simple, yet elusive points. These are concepts known to be true through common sense and insight. This book reads like the ""good parts"" of my best personal journals, without all the personal toil to get to these points. For me, this book bridged the gap between ""faith"" and science.

  Tolle is a really gifted teacher of mindfulness, or what he calls the power of now.However, I have one major complaint.  He sates depression is an ego fabrication, and uses his experience with depression and recovery there of, as evidence that it is nothing more than an ego fabrication.  He states the same thing in his newer book,  The New Earth.  While I am glad he transcended his depression,  it is arrogant for him to imply that the same should be true for anyone else.  My opinion - not all depression is the same - varying degrees, some could be in part or whole genetic....  If you struggle with a major mental illness, I would recommend you avoid this book and the New Earth.  And if you don't have a mental illness, take care you really question his perspective on this, so you don't pollute others with more of the mental health bias that is so rampant in our culture.

  This book was referred to me by a psychologist who practices mindfulness and uses it in his clinical practice. He knew that I was a positive psychology junkie who rarely read anything that was not steeped in academic research...So, when I received this book and immediately went to the back cover to see where Eckhart Tolle studied and got his PhD, I was immediately disappointed and a little angry with my friend. Knowing that my friend was one of the wisest people I knew, I decided to give it a try.It was apparent from the beginning that while this book was only 236 pages, it was going to take more effort to read. In fact, I found myself re-reading sentences and paragraphs, multiple times. This is a very 'deep' book with concepts that force you to close the book and contemplate before reading on.If you are leading a life where most of your thoughts are in the past or future, this book is for you. If you are leading a mostly mindless life, this book is for you. If you are looking for a little more meaning and purpose in your life, again, this is a great place to start. I refer to my notes on this book, often - if you need more mindfulness in your life (and who doesn't? :), this book provides tons of wisdom for everyone.

  I got off to a bit of a rocky start with this book, but I quickly got into it after a short time.This is a radical book. It stands much of what I have presumed to be true on its head. I realize that I have assumptions of life so basic that I never have examined them until now.I especially relate to the psychological notions of past (memory; life story) and future (worry and seeking fulfillment in the future). I had a vague idea of these two states, but this book has put them into sharp focus for me. I relate this to Carlos Castaneda and stopping the world and erasing personal history, which i now understand better now than ever before. I'm not sure I buy into the Don Juan idea of recapitalization or of the Eagle devouring our value added awareness at death unless we are clever enough to escape it, but this book has certainly been a life changer for me.My only complaint is that I am now finding that I have drifted off and have been captured in some meaningless monkey chatter of future or past, trying to rewrite the past, reliving something from the past, worrying about the future, running dialogs with someone about something someday. It's all very maddening.Fortunately, I retain a realization of this is what it is like to begin to awaken from such madness. I'm noticing what has been going on all of my life that I had not noticed before.The jig is up, the ego is mounting a final battle, and it looks to be shaping up to be a doosey. Well, it is entertaining, I'll give it that, as my mind does everything it can to avoid the now.My wife and I watched the 60's movie ""Charley"" (which is based on the story ""flowers for Algernon"" with some sex and sixties angst thrown in for good measure). I trust this awakening will not be followed by the death of the little mouse and a subsequent reversion to the mean. That would be mean indeed.

  After all these years I finally understand the events that happened to me and Eckhart explains it in a very understandable way. This book is an accompaniment or an embellishment to other spiritual or psychological guides. For those who have trouble understanding ""how"" to do what Eckhart is asking, ""Self-Esteem"" 3rd Ed, by Mathew McKay and Patrick Fanning have some specific exercises that are related to Eckhart's mindfulness that I found helpful. I wouldn't investigate too deeply into what enlightenment really is because it's not a ""study."" It's like life, you learn as you encounter the situation.

  I'm a follower of many thought gurus and teachers. However, this book just didn't do it for me. It felt very repetitive. Now, I understand that many things need to be repeated to be understood, but this was just too much. I'm about halfway through the book, but I feel I just can't go on anymore. I feel like I get what he is saying and it's just all repetitive after that.

  The message and practice in the book is essentially the same as Mindfulness, Vipassana,... but I enjoyed the lucid description positioned in todays western context. I found the feeling and welcome reminder it conveys encouraging and inspiring for my meditation practice.A few spiritual terms are used that initially where a bit more difficult to accept for me (coming from a very rational/scientific view), but they are no more than just a choice of terms/words as soon as you grasp their underlying meaning.

  The author asks the reader to surrender to the now in order to find peace.  He connects the concept of time to negativity to resistance to pain.  He suggests that most of humanity is unconscious of the essence of their lives and of their being and thereby living in the drama and suffering of the illusion of their story.

  There are those who point out - and correctly so - that what Tolle presents in this work is not original thought. To the best of my knowledge, he doesn't claim that the ideas presented in the book ARE original...in fact, throughout the book he references many of the world's religions. Tolle states in the Introduction that what he writes about is the essential truth that is found in all of the major religions, but which is too often obscured by being ""overlaid with extraneous matter"". I have to agree. If one were to read all of the many philosophies cited, I can't imagine the combined effect would provide clarity and overarching understanding for the reader. I have studied many of them myself, and finding a clear unifying thread is not a simple task.This is the brilliance of what Tolle has done; he's distilled many of these philosophies down to a core essence, and then states this information clearly and succinctly, without the veiled allusions or allegories that you find in many texts. In my case, I agree with another reviewer that pointed out that reading the Tao te Ching after reading TPoN provides a great deal more understanding and insight than previous readings.As the author points out early on, this is not a book you can grasp with your ego-driven, analytical mind; it is more along the lines of something you intuit as being true, and need to remain open to as you read. The good news is, Tolle doesn't ask us to believe anything; you can experience the truth of what he writes about if you simply put into practice what he writes about. I have found it to be very beneficial for my mental health and overall sense of well being in a short period of time, and I look forward to greater rewards with continued diligence and effort on my part. I have purchased several copies to give to friends and family, and I can't provide any higher rating than that.

  One way to judge if the book's teachings are real, is to put them to test against your own life experiences.  I did that for this book and came to a realization that psychological time did indeed play a great role in my life.  The switch to living in the now and using clock time is certainly not an easy endeavor, especially after a life time of identification with the past and projections into the future.I believe there is power in the now and it is worth the effort to live your life in the now and not in the past that you can't change and in the future that you don't know.Wick

  I read this book at a time when I was absolutely delusional. I'm so glad that I suffered through all my neurotic BS for years and years, because if I had been content with what most people consider to be a good life I would have never awakened. Now that I'm beginning to deepen my understanding I thought I'd throw this review up for others to read.I see how important it is for me to put this out there because nothing matters more than realizing the truth....not accepting some dogma which most people have done and continue to live with their filters which limit their ability to live in reality. Nothing matters more than this (not this book, but what the book may be able to bring about inside yourself); not money, fame, sex/any other shallow pleasure, your ambitions, past, not your family/relationships (not saying they aren't important...but ultimately relationships can be a hindrance if you are ignorant of the nature of their essence), and no idea of happiness or love that the majority of the humans on this planet buy into will make your life meaningful. All of these things may bring you some feeling of importance and acceptance...some pleasure....these pale in comparison to being able to live in wonder, with REAL joy and love.I had thought I knew what love was....I do now, and I know that most people aren't able to love....but we all have potential. I now know what bliss is...can you feel bliss from owning a big house or landing a lucrative career....can you feel love for everything by ""becoming"" an educated person with a nice office where you can display how great and smart you are, lining the walls with diplomas, certificates and awards? Will that person (or people) whom you long after completely fulfill you once your long thought out relationship plan comes to fruition? If you reflect on what you have wanted in the past and thought about obtaining and realize that it didn't fulfill you...it might have made you excited and anxious thinking about how great it would be once you got it...but then you get that thing and you loose interest in it...you look for something else you can think about obtaining, and the cycle just keeps you in this confused state of distraction from what is truly significant in life...the ONLY thing which is available to EVERYONE.I could say the present moment is all there is and how great it is and how everything else is an illusion and give you a logical basis which can't be refuted....but don't take my word for it...find out yourself. Do you know what a spider is?....when you asked ""what's that"" pointing to a ""spider"" your Dad might have said...""oh, that's a spider""; so now you can't see the spider, tree, birds or flowers because all you see is their labels. This gets so deep (I haven't fully realized the depth...each day is astonishingly new and insightful) and I want to share this with everyone...and you will too if you realize how trite the ""American dream"" is.You can go to school, get a good job, be in happy relationships and buy nice things AND realize that there is more to life....but please do yourself (and the rest of us) a favor and find out what is truly meaningful before you accept that your secure and highly planned out path to successful happiness with all your beliefs, ideas and opinions will hold water. I'm not saying drop your dreams, I'm saying find out what it is that you DO HAVE...that you always have...that you will always have...because you will never have anything else (speaking in the absolute). I hope you find out for yourself and maybe you can help others find out as well...there is nothing better you can do with your life than help someone find out.

  This book is, by far, the most inspirational piece of literature I've ever come across. I can quite honestly and literally say, that this book has changed my life. I large part is due to the fact that this book focuses on inner peace and enlightenment from an ""Everyday Life"" point of view.I spent my life a worrier and angry at the world, but never really realized it. I was miserable and even in my teens, I was always stressed and would go through periods of depression. After a while I began to think that there had to be something else. Obviously, things and people, were not giving me the fulfillment I desired. Then I was introduced to Eckhart Tolle's teachings and I purchased this book.Immediately after I began to read ""The Power of Now"", I became aware of those negative feelings and energy within me. Instantly they vanished and I remember the moment it happened. I was standing in my parking lot, by myself, and just began to laugh out loud. It was the most freeing and peaceful feeling I have EVER fealt. The peace continues, with focus, and determination to not fall into the old mind based patterns. I still live my life, spend time with friends, and have tons of fun. However, I do it all with a new sense of inner peace.I will not go into the teachings of the book in this review. If you're curious, pick up a copy. They aren't very expensive on Amazon. You don't have much to lose, but everything to gain. Not everyone, however, is ready for this teaching. You must be ready for a new way to live, because many of these ideas go against habits deeply embedded in our society. If you don't feel you can accept this teaching, no worries. The simple fact that you were open enough to try to see things differently, has helped to enrich your life.

  My mother and father are Christians - they study their bibles almost every day, to hopefully glean wisdom and to further incorporate the doctrine they find so important into the very foundation of who they are..I feel similarly to The Power of Now, and A New Earth. The books are less ""self help"" than ""self discovery"", and when you begin to synthesize the information, you come to realize how it's been there all along.More than teaching you something new, it's as profound as someone who always looks straight ahead being reminded that they can gracefully, and easily use their neck to turn their head - expanding their capability, as well as world view.Truly an enlightened text, which therefore enlightens those who read it. I do that however important you or i personally find this book, each person must be at a point in his or her life to really synthesize the message. for instance, you can gift this book - and you'll most likely want to - but the person who receives it may let it sit on a shelf for quite some time before something in them becomes curious. Rome wasn't built in a day, and ""a new earth"" won' be either i suppose ;)I highly suggest reading The Power of Now first. It's a bit more accessible upon first reading, and jumpstarts a beautiful change within you - when you're ready for it.

  Employing these concepts has freed me from mindsets and habits of thought that imprisoned me for 3 decades. I can’t begin to articulate the tremendous power that is accessible once these concepts are understood and lived. I’m not yet able to remain in the now all the time but my present moment awareness is developing day by day. I have experienced profound peace, love and joy. More than I even realized is possible prior to this transformation. It’s very much like a rebirth, a continual rebirth because you lose all negative ties to the past.

  As our world becomes more and more mind dominated, more scientific and rational, so must spiritual teachings.  The thousand-year-old teachings of Christianity, Buddhism, etc. are so full of arcane symbolism that modern men no longer can relate to, much less practice.  While the methods of Zen, vipassana, and some others are still very powerful; with recent progress in psychology and better understanding of the mind-body complex, modern men demand a more reasonable, explainable approach to spirituality.Eckhart's teachings, along with other recent developments, such as the Conversations with God series or the Untethered Soul, form a set of contemporary spiritual discourses that appeal very well to our logically minded population, especially the skeptical intellectuals.  These books are making great strides for spirituality.

If you purchase this book and read it and don't like it, it's not because it isn't worth the 5 stars - it's simply because you are not ready for it.  So hold onto it because you will most likely come back to it at some point.  Something made you want to buy it, something will lead you back to it.I love the question & answer format.  The author poses questions from a skeptic's point of view, which may help some people gain a better understanding of how to digest the information.  I also love man of the real world examples given.  After you become aware, how do you go on living in ""reality?""  I have not yet completed the book (I am more than halfway) and I am always finding answers to questions I didn't even know I had.That is my experience with this book.  I hope you experience something similar as well.  Happy reading!

  I listened to CDs of this book (read by the author) several years ago. It stuck with me, and I decided to read it, slowly, to try to really internalize the important messages about life. I have decided to read this book once a year to help me stay centered and more conscious than unconscious.

  So much of what we struggle with in life is due to the obvious which we either cannot, or refuse, to see.  The author does a remarkable job of making sense of how we unwittingly make our own lives much more difficult and painful, and showing how we can stop the insanity if we choose.I began reading this book last year, as I was dealing with overwhelming losses and knew I needed help.  I had to stop part-way through, as the author began speaking in stronger terms about a larger force of which we are all a part.  My belief system doesn't quite go in that direction, and as a result, I turned away from the book.  I came back to it a year later however, determined to benefit from the wisdom I had previously seen, and which had convinced me that there was much more to come.  I am so glad I did.  I still struggle with the ""we are all part of something bigger"" concept, but practically everything else in the book has really helped.  I plan to slowly reread it many times in the remainder of my life, and have also gone on to buy the CD set for listening in my car.  It is incredibly grounding, any time I read or listen to any of it.If you try it and it doesn't feel like the right thing at the right time for you, my suggestion is to just put it away for a while.  You'll know when the time is right for you to return to it; I hope you get as much from it as I have.

  How many times have you purchased a self help/growth book with high expectations?  I would usually read the jacket and say, ""that's me"" or that those are the goals for myself I wish to achieve.  I would eventually finish it, put it down and  find nothing has changed. For myself, more times than I care to count.  This is the first time I have found a book to actually work and show results.The book is basically about being present.  You wouldn't think that more than a few paragraphs would be needed to explain the benefits of being present and the consequences of not being present.  However, every sentence in this book provides insight and clarity I wouldn't have thought possible to convey with words.I find myself reading no more than a page or two at a time, reflecting on what was said, and then putting it into practice.  If you read this book like a novel, I believe it would be difficult to fully grasp what the author is saying.  My mind has become less busy, I am not as  easily distracted, I worry less about the future and negative past events no longer effect me, or at least not as much.This is the first time I have felt compelled to review a book because this is the first time I have had results.  I hope you give it a chance.

  His theories and methods are realistic and logical. For the first time, I read a book about enlightenment that actually has achieved a simple method, process and identification.Generally all books dealing with spirituality are always just end up saying that ""you just feel it and know"" or some other hypothetical b.s. Here, he clearly explains the idea behind the method of Being by recognizing thought as a separate entity from soul/Being... that is the ""Now"", and he explains how to identify, achieve and live in that state.The only other time I read something coming close to it with concrete method was when I was exploring the philosophies of Aleister Crowley, but Crowley delved into the rituals, meditation, and magik which then made it way too complex of an approach, turning the process into a cult in itself.

  Oh my, if I could go back in time to tell myself not to buy this book let alone waste hours of my life reading it, I would. It's condescending, barely cohesive babbling. By the time I got to chapter eight where he is mansplaining how a woman can connect to the being if she pushes past her anger and emotions from her flow I was rolling my eyes so hard I could barely continue to read. This is such a waste of recycled paper and I will recycle this book to save anyone the hardship of reading it and maybe give the trees that died to become it some peace at last.

  Remarkably refreshing contemporary reading on presence, in mostly understandable (and his own) language that doesn't require much previous preparation in terms of familiarity with esoteric systems/teachings. With a heavy leaning towards and parallels with Bhuddism, usiing a lot of quotes from various teachings, Christian, Bhuddist, etc., the author manages mostly to point to the way to get in to the moment. He is particularly successful in describing the various ways our own thoughts, and ego block the very possibility to get  closer to inner self. It is self-help though as he is not proclaiming to be a teacher, and has no such organization/set up, although he is very popular, and offers products through his website. It is a start therefore, and for the reader who wants to seriously go further on this path, (re) orientation on the various paths and options given for those by groups, schools, institutes, etc., is a necessary but not an easy task.

  There are many books that I have given high ratings and have the intention of going back to read; this is one of the few books that I actually started re-reading immediately after I finished the first reading.  While I admit that I don't agree with everything that is written in the book, a great deal of the book makes sense even from a Christian perspective (which is also why I don't agree with everything in it).  I'm still on my second reading and I'm intentionally reading slower this time around, but I am consciously and actively applying the suggestions/steps.  I can't honestly say that this works--yet; which may be that red light, but at the very least I can say that I tried and it is quite interesting.

  I picked up this book years ago and quickly looked through it and thought it was some sort of New Age philosophy that was of very little benefit.  Years later and having gone through some minor personal problems, I decided to buy it and read it.  Right from the beginning, I realized how incredibly useful and applicable this book was.  It's the type of book that you can read numerous times and benefit from, because it helps to solidify this way of thinking, (or not...lol).  I'm almost done with reading it a second time.  In this busy world where our minds seem to run amok and negatively affect us, Eckhart Tolle's words were so simple, yet ingenious!

  I reached certain point in my life where I felt that something was missing, that I needed more, spiritually speaking.  I was born and raised under certain religious denomination but all my life I had so many unanswered questions and was told not to question, but to just have “faith”.  It wasn’t enough for me. I looked for answers in other religions, but still something was missing.  While doing some research I found this book.  It really opened my eyes… all along the answers to all my questions were WITHIN myself, I just had to look deeper.  I’ve been practicing some of Mr. Tolle’s teachings; I know I still have a long way to go but I know I’m on the right path now.

  I heard many of the things that Eckhart Tolle says in this book. I know now that I didn't really understand them until I read this book.When a person speaks, writes, sings, or acts from their heart it's powerful. This whole book is written that way. If you're interested in spirituality, begin here.He writes about quieting the mind and listening to you're spirit. I've heard people write and speak about being here in the ""NOW"". Eckhart Tolle tells you exactly how to do this.I also have ""Stillness Speaks"" book and I peeked into it. It's outstanding as well. ""The Power of Now"" was listed very highly on a list of books that have transformed peoples' lives, First or Second and ""Stillness Speaks: was also there at about Fifth place. These are books you will enjoy and will read over and over again. There are a lot of good books on Spirituality but Eckhart Tolle's books are better than 99% of them. Also they are inexpensive.

  This is not JUST a self-improvement or New-age book, it is MUCH more than that!To me this is EXACTLY a restatement for our time of the essence of ALL spiritual teachings (to paraphrase Tolle).  How much bigger than that can we get?  This EXPLAINS what Jesus (and Buddha, amongst others) meant and how we can not only believe, but KNOW the truth of God.  To have an explanation of what some of the strange biblical (and other religious books) statements & parables mean is an eye-opener of note:The parable of the servant waiting for his master's return;The story of the prodigal son;Jesus's statements ""before Abraham was, I am"", ""Look under a rock, I am there"";""No man who puts his hands to the plough & looks back, is fit for the Kingdom of God""The Book of Mary and Jesus's instruction:  ""Seek the child of True Humanity within (yourselves)"".  ""Those who seek WILL find it"".""Be Still and know that I am God"".The bible's statements are meant to be lived (another Tolle quote), not merely believed in mentally!  This book explains how.  The fact that Tolle explains all this in a religious-sect-INDEPENDENT way will help anyone REGARDLESS of religious affiliation.While listening to the audiobook you CAN literally FEEL the energy response to Tolle's words inside you.  I coupled this with the Wayne W. Dyer book

That being said, it was completely worth it. I highly recommend reading this. Tolle brilliantly explains how the human ego stands in the way of joy by attaching itself to thoughts that cause us to suffer. Some of the themes contained in TPON are covered in other books, notably Michael Singer's The Untethered Soul, but it is beautifully written and has the power to change the now.

Reclaiming our power, dissipated in the illusion of the past or future by bringing the attention into the now and learning to cultivate the relationship with the present moment. Birthing presence out of life. Transcending the life situations and living life. A treat. What a wonderful book!

  I came across this book at a book store in year 2003. When I started reading it I really liked the first few pages. A month or so after that I ordered it on amazon. I replaced my morning and evening prayers with reading this book and doing meditation (pondering on brief content from this book and going into a no mind state). This book changed my life. The content in this book resonated so well with me that I had never had such experience before. As I would read content from this book, heavy loads of suffering was being lifted off of me. Suddenly I became aware of the noise my mind was constantly generating. Prior to this book, I generated quite a bit of suffering (which I wasn't much aware of) over the years and this book made me realize that 99% of the suffering was all self-generated. I am writing this review more than a decade after living by the values (being present) reflected in this book. Thank you Eckhart for a miracle!

  The essence of the book: detach yourself from yourself.I read somewhere that your worst enemy was yourself. For Tolle, it's your mind; for him, ""your mind"" is a tyrant lurking behind your neck, seeking the right opportunity to torment you day in and day out; hustling you to live in the past or in the future. He advises that you should shut up this fiendish monster in your head. He claims people live less fulfilling lives all because of the noise the mind produces: choking you down; overtaking your willpower, your life. ""You are not your mind,"" he declares.I must admit -- after hearing for a long time about the wonderful and transforming power of the mind -- that I was taken aback by Tolle's thought -- perhaps a little startled to find myself nodding yes, as I flipped pages after pages. The way he presents it: a fight between the heavenly Angel and the evil One on your shoulders, in your head (of course, Tolle's insight made it out to be quite less humorous, even a bit pernicious if one  fails to rein it). Control it, and you're enlightened. Tolle explains in a Q/A format some of the most profound quests that have eluded humans for centuries. His pantheistic take on God might appear unsettling to some. However, most of the other topics touch on the do's and don'ts you could probably find in most inspirational literatures.Tolle goes further:Consciousness: the Way Out of Pain; Moving Deeply Into the now; Mind Strategies for Avoiding the Now; The State of Presence; The Inner Body... and many more subjective topics.  In general, he states that most of our ills exist because of our lack of knowledge on how to control our inner self, how to tame it into accepting ""what is,"" and surrendering beyond reproach.

  Great Yogis of India usually accepted students only after they managed to disidentify themselves from their ego. Indeed, without that crucial step any spiritual advancement is only an illusion (based on delusions of the ego). The author covers this issue in an understandable language and brings it to the reader even closer by an honest account of his own experience. A very valuable book for someone starting to search for a spiritual advancement. My only critisism is that the author seems to view the disidentification from the ego as the ""end"". To me this is only the beginning. Also, the author never mentions God or any higher beings. In my experience, without their help (which we have to ask for) even this first step is impossible.

  This book sums up why we're here on the earth like no other!  Eckhart Tolle is a master spiritual teacher who shines the light of his awareness to those of us who are still stumbling in the dark.  He helps us to connect with the divine radiance of who we really are thus fulfilling our purpose here on the earth.Eckhart serves as a guide who emphasizes the present moment as a portal into our true selves.  I have read his book over and over, and it centers me every time I read it.  It's for those people who see that there is much dysfunction here on planet earth and are wanting to be part of the solution.  It helps me to shine the light of awareness on my everyday life and Eckhart's crystal clear words are a great source of strength and inspiration.  He takes the great spiritual teachings from all over the world and sums them up with the greatest clarity and wisdom.

It is all about concentrating on the now aspect of life instead of dwelling in the past or being fearful of what the future holds.

  [...] the first in a series of spiritually-themed novels, I am always on the outlook for spiritual books that help broaden my perspective. This book was recommended to me and I am delighted that I took up the suggestion.This is a book that will speak to any spiritual searcher regardless of their religious background. Mr. Tolle provides the tools that will empower you to transform your life. Practicing awareness of the present moment allows one to appreciate each passing moment as well as providing a means for letting go of thoughts and emotions that do not serve one's sense of joy. By staying present to the moment one can also reduce anxiety connected to future concerns.I always keep the book on hand when I'm traveling in order to reflect upon it whenever I have a spare moment. I am currently reading the book for the second time and I continue to gain new insights from the book and from my life as a result of reading it and practicing its principles.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of ""The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude""

  Eckhard Tolle basically depicts that when you judge or react to a thought or a certain situation, your mind will interpret things in terms of the past. This means that your body and mind is ""conditioned"" to feel a certain way. This is the result of all your past history as well of the collective mind-set you inherited.He mentions that we are not our minds and that our minds is just a recollection of labels with events and things we just associate with each other. (This is ultimately what causes us to react or feel a particular way)So everything we see and judge through the present is actually through the ""eyes of the past"" and we get a totally distorted view of it.Once you dismiss all the labels, associations, and the prior influences to your judgment, you will start to see the bigger picture of why you act the way you do, or think the way you think.Eckhard Tolle believes that once you observe and realize that the past is merely just a recollection of habitual thinking and experiences of what society inflicts upon you, then you can grasp control of what you do in that very exact moment. Thus surrendering to the present and seizing the NOW.Mastering and actualizing this art will allow your own deepest self accessible.

  Potentially life changing for me.  Although I always preached about not living in the past I was.  To keep this brief, If you are angry and/or depressed you are living in the past.  If you are stressed or have ongoing anxiety you are living in the future.  There is no past so to speak as there is no future, only the moment.

  Having finally read it, I can certainly understand why so many people are drawn to this book. Eckhart draws from the ages of perennial philosophy and articulates it with incredible fluidity and simplicity. He also draws from the great teachings of various major religions and applies them in largely unfamiliar, 'esoteric' ways. He doesn't personally ascribe to any particular religion in this book but it's clear that his background is Christian. The entire goal of the book can be summarized, very simply, by focusing one's attention in the 'present moment'. Being a Christian myself, I found the book intriguing, but couldn't help but have a sense of disappointment in the very nebulous description of God. God seems to have no personality but was more the 'universal intelligence'. Eckhart is understandably cautious about how he uses the word 'God'. However, to me God seems to be so much more than just an intelligence. I personally perceive God, as do many Christians as an extremely caring and loving being. One who has a personality of his own. A compassionate nurturer who empathizes with the suffering of people. This book paints an 'intelligence' of indifference whereas according to the New Testament - God is Love. I realize that this critique is biased, based upon my own experience. I gave the book 4 stars for the  incredibly articulate manner in which it was written. However for me, it falls short of seeing the beautiful person who is at the center of it all, that is, God.

  I'm a very skeptical person and most people that know me would be surprised that I even read this book. The basic principle underlying this book is amazingly effective.  The simple trick presented to stop your mind chatter is worth the price of the book alone.  There's a lot for anyone to learn from this book and most of it is novel (at least to a mainstream reader such as myself).  I don't necessarily believe/understand a lot of the second order concepts in the book (Being = god, etc), however I do find myself relating to many of the situations the author presents and had already personally experienced several of the things he describes and explains.  I wouldn't consider myself ""present"" enough to dispute any of the author's more fantastical claims.  Regardless, applying the fundamental concept ""works.""

  A few years ago, I listened to Tolle's A New Earth first on audiobooks as I had found the audiobook at my local library. I got so much from it that I listened to nothing else for a period of 3 months while commuting in my car. I also shared it with a co-worker who had just as enthusiastic response as I did. Once I could no longer renew it from the library, I bought it from Amazon.com because I had to have my own copy. I just now got The Power of Now on audiobooks, and I like it just as much (though I still prefer A New Earth). There are times when I am blown away and delighted by a sentence, or passage, that rings so true! It is deliciously freeing. Just lovely to learn that it's okay to let go of what is contrived and inauthentic: my compulsive thoughts about my past and future. So glad I discovered this author. Eckhart Tolle's teachings calm me down, gives me hope, lifts some weight off my shoulders, and inspires me to live more consciously, kindly and bravely. Thank you!

  Often, for a review to be meaningful, it helps to know where the reviewer is coming from in their own point of view.By most accounts, as a former pastor in an evangelical denomination and someone trained as an apologist in Biblical Literature from a primarily literalistic and fundamentalist point of view, I shouldn't like this book.  I should be lambasting it a ""new age,"" ""mystical"" and ""universalism and pantheism.""Yet I'm not.  I found the book interesting and very helpful.  I found the challenges within it to my own patterns of thinking to be worthwhile and I wasn't particularly threatened by the fact that it's a spiritual book (not religious) and it draws from multiple sources including the teachings of Christ, Zen, Hinduism, gnostic writings, Buddhism, Taoism etc.That said, I recognize that there are elements of the book with which I don't and others from my traditions will not agree. In spite of that, I still highly recommend the book.  While the book is undoubtedly spiritual it is also based in good psychology and it opens the reader who allows themselves to detach from themselves and take the role of an observer of their own habits and thought processes.  It provides insight into how our ""thought habits"" take us out of the present moment and utilize our minds to either continually dwell on the past or worry about the future.Emotions are in significant measure a product of how we think and how we condition our minds.  When we lose the need to continually keep our minds ""busy"" with things that keep us out of the present moment, then we can live in freedom and independent of our circumstances.  Our emotions become connected to the present moment and we're able to ""live"" freely.These are not new or unique ideas, even in Christian Tradition.  There is a long and strong tradition of mysticism that extends back to the very earliest church and church fathers.  Much of what is touched in by Tolle would be considered fairly standard fare in the eastern Tradition of Christianity.  It is to the Western analytical mind, that much of this is a great challenge.So, while I don't necessarily agree with and give equal weighting to all the sources used within the book, that doesn't mean that I don't see the parallels. More than intellectually evaluating the book analytically, the point of the book is to learn how to turn off the mind and move beyond the ""noise"" that we create to distract ourselves from being present within the moment and enjoying life.I find that to have been a very helpful thing and I'm glad I read the book.  I likely will reread it on occasion for the reminder and reinforcement.5 stars.bart breen

  Basically, ""The Power of Now"" is a few good points reiterated over and over again.  This is also a book that is designed for people who carry over insecurities or anger from past events OR spends too much time moping about present circumstances and wishing it was sometime when things get better. I do know a few people in the former group.I did learn one mantra from the book.  It's not advised as a mantra, but I turned it into one: ""This is just my imagination"".  A good point that was made was that we know our dreams (as in actual, while sleeping ""dreams"" and not wishes for the future) are not real, but we seem to think situations that we dwell on, or conversations that we imagine with others have authenticity to them.  Good point - They aren't real unless we actually have/do them.This basically has no practical advice, though.  A friend advised it regarding a relationship issue I'm having.  BUT, it's a present relationship issue.  I do state ""This is just my imagination"" if I catch myself over-thinking it while at, for example, work, but while it is a distraction (because it is current, though not IMMEDIATE), I am not the type who lets their last relationship(s) affect the current one, etc.  As long as the thinking helps me clarify things, I don't really feel like I am doing anything bad as long as I acknowledge that while I may want thing one way or another, I accept that it is what it is.I guess this is a good way to describe who should be reading the book: People with difficulty accepting realities.What I thought this book completely lacked was any real advice on over-coming true obstacles.  I suppose plenty of people dwell on things far past when is healthy.  If this is you, then the advice in this book is indispensable.  The thing that I was hoping for that is NEVER addressed is over-coming true tragedies and grief, but it just seems that this is lumped together.Also, it's page after page of the exact same info.  I didn't learn anything new as the book progressed. This whole book could have been a 40-page essay.  I'm not sure how he managed a sequel.

  This is one of the books talking about how to be 'present' amid all the noises in people's mind. Overall it is very well done. The key thing is to practice it and apply it to one's daily life, not an easy thing to do.

  This book resonated with me on many levels and is definitely a life changer. I've suffered most of my adult life from obsessive negative thought patterns.  In one book, Mr. Tolle has managed to effectively diagnose the problem and offer a workable solution. Coming from a recovering atheist, this book is a must read for anyone looking for a guide to spirituality that stands on its own two feet.

  This book has prevented many days of depression for me, I""m convinced of that.  Just like the book says, it should be MANDATORY reading for all kids in HS.  I ABSOLUTELY agree with the author on that point.  This book will give you PERMISSION to stop thinking and ENJOY your life.  It really changed the paradigm for me as to why I was depressed.  I was simply THINKING that I was depressed.  When I stopped thinking, POOF, no longer depressed :)  Definitely worth the money and time.

  I grew up in a moderate Baptist church. But, it wasn't until I was 40 years old that I consciously and decidedly surrendered my life fully to God. I made an absolute commitment at that point to follow, as best I knew how, the living Spirit of the living God. This was the real beginning of my deeper spiritual search.I studied the Bible, reading and praying over it many, many times. I involved myself in numerous Christian organizations, seeking to serve the God I knew. Also, I worked in the effort to restore the lives of the homeless and addicted. My sincere desire has always been to serve God and bring God's Unconditional Love to all people and all creation.Eventually I attended divinity school and graduated with a master of divinity degree. I learned to research the Scriptures and other historical and relevant literature with an open minded and spirited critique. After divinity school I continued my search, deeply exploring other religious traditions as well as more current writings concerning the Spirit of God and how that Spirit works within each of us and in our world as a whole.The teachings of Jesus, because of my Christian background, have always deeply touched me... ""may they be One as we are One,""... ""the Kingdom of God is inside you""... you must die to yourself to find real life. Also, I found a deep resonance with these more spiritual teachings of Jesus within some aspects of Buddhism, Taoism, and Sufism.All this is proper background to my sense of truth contained in ""The Power of Now."" I have read hundreds of books in my search for greater truth... none, I believe, have been written in a more direct, relevant, and accurate way. Eckhart has put together a deeply enlightened and accurate instruction manual for reaching the highest stages of faith and consciousness. I cannot recommend it more highly for those who are ready. The readiness required is that the personal shell of ego, and ethnocentricity (which would include one's attachment to one's own faith tradition), must be broken. This is the shell that has blinded me in the past... and serves to blind everyone still centered in his or her own separate identity.When your shell has been broken, or when you feel that you are ready for this kind of challenge... the challenge to transcend your own current stage of faith or level of awareness, please read this book. It has the power to liberate and to guide you into the ""abundant life.""

  The author is describing Buddhist philosophy using his own language.  However, he makes a very good point.  And that point is that we must live in the now.  When you live in the past or live for the future, you are missing real living.  The past is done, and we may not live to see the future.  But, we should enjoy every moment of now.

  This is a wonderful book that guides us to slow down a bit. Stop and realize the true essence and nature of things. Contemplate on the mortality of how we identify ourselves and how we identify with ourselves, and on the true immortality of who we really are, and our oneness with Being.Being somewhat very lightly familiar with mystical sufi islam, i found though that the way in which Tolle describes his matters are mostly over complicated. The ideas and principles in the book are somehow embedded in Us by nature, and thus should not require this sophistication or complexity. Nevertheless, the book serves as an amazing way to awakening. Bringing us back to what really matters, and even describing it from angles we never thought of before.Overall, the book has had an immense effect on me. I remember someday in the distant past to be somewhat primitively aware of what Tolle is talking about, but to have sadly lost it along the way, and i believe that ""now"" is the perfect moment to get back on track.

However, The Power of Now has impacted me so much that I feel indebted to this author and compelled to write this review. This book is worth more than the money I paid for it.

This book contains the truth is a very powerful form.This book is the end of suffering. Eckhart guides you through a profound and massive mental shift that gives you a completely new and beautiful reality. Almost like being born into the World for the first time.I have hope for once in my life. I also now realize that everything is going to be fine. I can be happy in the face of any circumstance.Each day I reread excerpts from this book and it takes me deeper into the NOW.

  Wow, what an amazing book. As you read this book you sense and understand its message deeply. I think you will get the most out of ""The Power of Now"" if you are open and ready for it. As the author writes in the introduction, he speaks to your soul, and I think that this is why I found it so effective.As I read the book I could clearly feel many preconceptions I had melting away and my awareness growing page after page. It is a spiritual book but also a book about human psychology. Everything I read rang true and I was able to implement what I read instantly in day-to-day life. I could not only understand myself but also others better. While I have been slowly ridding myself of emotional baggage and preconceptions over the last couple of years, I feel that this book helped me progress much faster. I first read it two months ago, and since then I have noticed that much of the remaining fear and unease I was still feeling gradually being displaced by an increasing sense of lightness and ease. I can identify arising negativity more quickly now and stop it before it progresses which helps keep anger and sadness at bay. And not being a slave of your thoughts and emotions is truly freeing. Together with regular meditation and practice of awareness, this book is changing my life for the better! :)I think that ""The Power of Now"" would be useful to anyone who wants to understand and improve themselves. I wish that it were required reading in school and hope that one day schools form a curriculum to educate children how to make the world a better place. I am now getting this book for family and friends... I feel like they should know about the book and hope that they read it soon!

  I picked up my first copy of this book off a $1 table in an old bookstore in Echo Park, CA some years ago. I was in a rut and honestly feel this book was waiting for me to find it. A few years later I re-read the book and even purchased the audio version to reiterate some of the concepts.

  Let me tell you how truly special this book is! About 1/3rd of the way through it, it has managed to achieve what 6 therapist/psychologist over my lifetime so far, have failed to do for me. It has given me a spiritual awakening! I'm 44 years old and have had severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with Anxiety most of my life. About 5 years ago, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. That also affects the mood/mental state by causing depression and feelings of hopelessness during flare-ups. Just 4 days into reading this book and my road rage is gone, I am more friendly and tolerant to other people, I have been treating my husband kinder and with more understanding, I have been learning to control the racing thoughts in my mind that were poisoning me, and I appreciate and admire the beauty of nature more than ever! For years I have been looking for peace and a way out of the vicious stress cycle I was stuck in. Is this going to be easy? Is it an overnight fix? No. You have to want to feel at peace and take control of your life away from your mind. It will take a lot of practice and I am going to learn how to meditate as well. But for the first time in my life I feel like I can get better! I have been told many times that there is no cure for PTSD. BUT it can be controlled and managed and you can live a relatively normal, joyful life. I was at a point in my life though where I am longing for peace and happiness. My body and mind are tired from what I have put them through all these years. I knew I had to make a change if I want to be at peace. If you are determined you have to change, if you are tired of being stressed and how it affects your family and friends, if you yearn for the peace and joy you have never know, but seen other people experience, delve into this book with an open mind and see what it does for you! It CAN change your life!!!

  I was going through a tough time, trying to deal with depression, with life, when I saw this book recommended by Gillian Anderson on her official web site where she lists some of her favorite things. I was in a local bookstore when I happened on it, picked it up, gave it a quick glance, and was immediately entranced by its message. To truly live in the NOW is quite difficult, and I know I have been riddled with chaotic mind, never being able to quiet the noisy chatter in my head. I was constantly futurizing, looking into the past and using both as a crutch to not live RIGHT NOW. It is so important a message that everyone needs to embrace it before we get swallowed up by the hype and lies that are fed to us by our own minds. This books makes you become aware of the present and how with each day you can become happier with being in the NOW, which is to say by living life to its fullest by just BEING! I cannot express this like Eckhart can, but please read this book and it will unfold its wisdom like a flower...slowly. This is the greatest gift I have given myself in such a long time.

  I think most will consider this New Age foo-foo. I have been in many esoteric Orders that teach a lot of complex ritual designed to get one to the very experience one can have if you actually GET what he is saying in this and his original work ""the Power of Now"". For those who've thought the secret to happiness was based on some kind of hard work behind secretive doors, or lots of money, power, etc....it's so simple. We want to intellectualize everything, or make it more difficult than it really is. There is no real secret to discover, we don't have to waste a lot of time figuring things out.

Eckhardt's philosophy dissects life's events and helps one understand that fighting events is a waste of precious time and energy, and that moving forward can't happen until acceptance takes place.I was laid off twice in 2 years through no fault of my own. I felt ashamed and humiliated to use unemployment credits to pay for food. I lost my home and my once impeccable credit. 10 million Americans were suddenly in the same situation, but I felt especially cheated.  I quickly found a lesser job to get off government assistance, but for a solid year, I cried and complained to anyone who would listen about how unfair it was. A good friend recommended ""The Power of Now"" CD set.  I painfully listened to Eckhardt's strange voice and slow cadence while driving each morning and evening. When my thoughts drifted off, I replayed the track and forced myself to focus.  Then, I listened again and again, hearing something new each time.  I think we all inherently know crying over spilled milk is useless, and that tomorrow is promise to no one, but advertiser's play on past tragedy and prod us to fear the future in order to take our cash. Learn to ignore them and live fully in the present.Hearing and practicing ""The Power of Now,"" for roughly 5 months, helped me change my perspective, heal from the anger and bitterness of losing a job, and I open my mind to new possibilities. I was able to pray again and a great job opened up. Shortly afterward, I loaned out my CD's and the borrower lost them. It's been two years, so I've just received my second set to reinforce what I learned.

  This is a truly life-changing book!  Eckhart Tolle uses an easily-relatable format to guide readers through the process of moving from an unconscious to a conscious approach to everyday living, thinking and breathing.  I strongly recommend it to anyone looking to make changes and approach life in a more positive and rewarding way!  I only wish I had read this years ago; but as they say, ""When the student is ready, the teacher is there.""

  For me, the book was a bit hard to get into at the beginning. I think it was because my ""mind"" kept talking to me while I was reading which made it hard to concentrate, plus it took me some time to get used to how he ""speaks"". I had to reread the beginning a few times to get up to speed. BUT... boy was it worth the effort! It has completely changed the way I look at myself, my reactions, & my entire life! It's been a true gift to myself. I still need to practice what I've learned, but I feel the shift already. I'm genuinely happier within each moment because I know to notice it now. By just sharing some passages with my husband & the basic principles, he finds himself better able to cope with his day to day life too.  Now that I've finished one full read-through, I expect to read it over and over again!

  It's an enchanting thought, isn't it? In the middle of a society whose centers of political power are emanating stale rot to the accompaniment of bugles, we're beginning to see a vibrant coalescence of awareness (COA) among ordinary people.  Extraordinary ordinary people that is.Of all the works I've reviewed, I feel this book by Mr. Tolle[1] has the most potential for making fundamental positive changes in how we connect to our ""higher powers."" Eckhart Tolle is an innocent from abroad, an ""extraordinary ordinary"" man, who, totally apart from any motivational or spiritual movement of the times, came into a peak experience that changed his whole way of looking at things:...For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2007

  This book was really good. It helped me a lot to realize things that were actually common sense but I still needed to be reminded about so I could start to incorporate in my every day life. I think that people who's thinking about buying this book should be aware that it's not some kind of practical guide to how to live in the now (I mean: it's not going to tell you: ""to connect with the Now you have to do this and this"") but in reality it involves a lot of self-identification and connecting to your body, spirit and mind.

  The Power of Now is such a great book. Before I read it, I had some anger issues and some more not so comforting habits. But after reading it, I am now calmer, I know how to control my anger, I am more present, I am more aware of what's going on in my body.

  I learned a lot of wise advice from this book.  Overall it is well-written, although I disliked the question-answer format. I'd prefer a regular format, followed by question-answer sections in each chapter.I've never been exposed to such an emphasis on being in the moment. I have read up on Eastern wisdom, but have never experienced the point of being in the moment emphasized as vehemently as in this book.  In particular, the following idea resonated with me, a paraphrased epitome of the entire book:  anything we've ever experienced, or will experience, will happen in the now - therefore, resolve to live in the now, instead of the the imaginary abstractions of past and future.There were however a few sections where Tolle seems full of it- especially sections where he restates a profound idea (obtained from elsewhere) without sufficient references to the source. His casual references to saints and prophets was also annoying. I objected to these, since it sounded like he perceived  the sources to be his peers. I prefer him to only focus on his concepts and stop sounding like he conceived the ideas, many of which he must've learned in traditional Eastern texts, without providing references.

If you are in a place where you want to learn how to ""Know Thyself"" this is a must have read.  And you might have to read it a few times.  I suggest you read like 4 pages, then sit quietly and think about what you read.  You might even take notes along the way.

  This is a revolutionary read. I have resisted books relating to spirituality and religion forged from my own experiences of the church and the corruption that is associated. I used to go to a pentecostal church where the magic at front of stage was purely a front to extract money and followers to complete the agenda of the few. This book has opened my eyes to true reality and empowered me to walk the path of enlightenment, including giving me the tools to help others identify and free themselves from the mental bondage and anguish of living in a corrupt and greed driven society.If you have an internal murmuring that questions life, questioning why you cannot disconnect yourself mentally from work or family, or can't quite grasp why you keep making the same relationship mistakes over and over, or why you feel rage, frustration or fear when a situation does not go the way you predicted - then I highly recommend this book. If you are incredibly mentally or emotionally burdened I would recommend reading it twice, as the tools you gain throughout the book will help you focus on the content if you read a second time.If you are deeply cynical of religion and spirituality, please reduce the urge to close the book at the mere mention of God, Jesus, Buddha or any scripture - Eckhart requires these as labels or signposts to guide the reader throughout the book, as he will describe the more you read.I have already bought copies for my staff that are having personal and disconnecting from work related issues, forewarning them of the spiritual and religious connotations in the book, as I am sure everyone has had some form crisis with a religious organisation, and most humans don't like religion being forced or subliminally marketed to them.I write this review based on past experiences to connect with anyone that might be hesitant in pursuing this book.

  I have mixed feelings. The book is very specific and presents a superb model of psychotic mind. I read a few other self-help books in the past, but they just weakly hint in the direction obscured by unnecessary layers. Compared to those Power of Now gives a clear explanation of the very basic foundation. On the other hand the book is full of paragraphs presenting unsubstantiated theories using the vocabulary reserved for physics. Those became a training site for me to spot my uneasy feelings arising, but it doesn't look like they are purposely there for counter-signalling.I wanted to give this book as a gift, before I reached the end, but now I hesitate. I'd like an unbundled version. I would recommend Peter Welch ""And Then I Thought I Was a Fish"" as an antidote companion. I got a hint about it from a completely different source and was surprised how well those two books align.

I read the entire book and highlighted the parts that really stood out to me, and I read those every time I needed some quick ""help"".

  It's the most influential spiritual/self-help book I have ever read. It's a real life changer. I began reading thinking that it would be just another self-help book; but reading on I saw that the book carries tremendous power and it starts to shift the reader's consciousness. You'll want to use the techniques described in the book because the sense of here and now will feel so sweet and satisfying. You'll feel the inclination to go deeper in that.

  The first few chapters of this book really helped me to have several important realizations. The idea that most of the things we worry and stress about don't exist in the present moment isn't new, but somehow the way this was delivered in this book really brought it home for me. There are many important insights in this book. It did seem to trail off towards the end. I didn't find the last few chapters helpful for me, but maybe others will.

  I read this book very slowly.  Only a few pages, or a few paragraphs are enough to reconnect my spirit with the now.  I find, the miracle of creation is all around me, simple, complex, charming.  I find that my body and earthly presence is the tip of the iceberg.  The rest of my inner being, all that I have done and will do, is in the unmanifest, and it is alive.  In the unmanifest, perhaps Mr. Tolles spirit will contact me, actually, that occurs.  But, perhaps I wil meet him someday in the manifest.  Anyway,  enjoy. peace.

  I love Eckhart Tolle, thus below my comments reflect my passion for his teachings. As you know everything is relative, in this case, my review is relative to my personal experience.The most profound book I have ever read. Finally I have touched the depth of consciousness. When you are ready, you may understand it. Otherwise, it may be a heavy book. It's like giving a computer book to a technology savvy versus someone that is not familiar with computers. I have also read every other book of this author. I find this book to be the starting book into the author philosophy. This book will help you understand other books that may be more difficult without this base knowledge such as The New Earth. There are several other spiritual teachers, but this Author is the only one that is truly effective that contains substance making a difference in my life. Other authors always leave me with nothing, lot's of words that don't lead anywhere.This book was given to me from a friend and it was the best experience ever that changed my life. I am glad she pushed me to start reading it, because I kept it on my bookshelf for weeks. Once I started reading it I was astonished and since then my life changed, my eyes were opened. However, not everyone is ready to understand. I have tried sharing it with some other people, but not everyone was able to read it. Since my background of meditation, spirituality, and introspection, this book came easy to read and understand. For me this book was the missing block from my spiritual path.Thanks Eckhart Tolle for helping humans make it to the next stage of consciousness.Good luck and I hope that anyone coming across this book is ready to discover the realm of non-thinking, non-judging, non-labeling. I would say, this is a non-mystical, clear understanding of what's behind religions. This can help any person to understand more their religious/spiritual path. The book is neutral, it doesn't favor any religion over another. It brings everything together into one as it should be.My message to everyone:Gaining more knowledge doesn't make people wise. Wisdom should be developed in pair with knowledge. Too much thinking stresses you out. Practice meditation. Discover the ego in you (we all have it), but you don't have to listen to it. The mind wants to think taking you away from what you are currently doing. Be aware of compulsive-recurring thoughts that are draining your energy. You should be able to stop the flow of thoughts, regain energy, feel at peace, in between daily tasks. This will bring wisdom in your actions. Otherwise, stress can only led you to poor results, poor performance, poor outcome. Empower yourself with gaps of non-thinking, which will make you experience FREEDOM. That's were you can find freedom, in your head only. It's nice to stop the mind flow of thoughts. You'll feel light, free, happy, and worry-free. Otherwise, your mind keeps generating thoughts causing you to be slave of recurring/compulsive thinking. That's why people drinks or get drugs (legal and illegal), to experience freedom from your mind that never stop stressing you out. Alcohol causes more issues than benefits, same as some drugs. Learn how to become free from your mind and from addictions. Then you can start enjoy life and express yourself at your full potential. This book is a pointer to freedom. Here is the door, can you open it and discover what's in it?

  This book needs to be read and reread until words become fully consciously and unconsciously part your life, so pain, fear recede to leave room for peace in the mind, body and life. The message is clear and help to reach a new understanding of messages / parables in religious / spiritual texts. It is challenging in its application but every moment of presence / being is a step toward awakening.

  Eckart Tolle shows how to look at the ego and see what it really is.  And, what it really is not.  The principles in the Power of Now have made my life so much clearer and I have way more peace than I have ever had.  Surrendering the ego and how to surrender it has been key.  This is a must read for every single soul.  I have urged everyone in my family and all my friends to read this book.  Our relationships are so much better.  Tolle brings into practice the concept of living in the now and how now is the only reality there is.  I realized that I had been addicted to my pain, my story, living in my past which no longer existed and was therefore unreal.  I am so happy that Mr. Tolle has shown us the way to live a more fulfilling life by living in the now.

  This book is perfect for people who are:- Has anxiety- Is emotional- Maybe you're just sad or depressed- Overthink-everything or Over-analyze everything- Loves Drama- Thinks about the past constantly- Thinks about the future constantlyThe first half of the book is pure gold, however I feel that the second half of the book is so-so. The first half gives you everything you need, the second half of the book might put some people off as it gets more religious.When you actually live in the now, it's beautiful, you're tranquil, happy, and calm. You care about everything around you, rather than thinking about the past and future. As this book mentions, everything, including being in the ""Now"" requires practices. And I think this is a great start.This is my first book review because, well, I had to give it praise.

It has changed my way of thinking, and my perspective and gratefulness of life in general.

  ...the present moment is all you ever have. ""There is never a time when your life is not this moment."" This passage from the book, hit me like a ton of bricks. Why am I worrying about the past and the future? I'm just putting myself through a type of ""hell"" on earth. My problems are not occurring right now, they either already happened or I'm projecting a problem into the future, I can not change them now! Why bother worrying? Why not find peace and happiness in my own present moment.This is an excellent book. I found it at the perfect time after reading a marriage self-help book that was based on self-differentiation. This book is helping me ""hold onto my true self"" not my mind made self, but the self that is underneath all emotional baggage.I highly recommend this book!

  I believe this is not like any other self-help, or zen teaching books out there. My mom and I both found guidance with the wise words of Eckhart Tolle. It's written in a way that beginners can grasp, in a question/answer form that makes you feel like you're having a personal conversation. This gives the base that one needs to progress in their spiritual enlightenment, something we should probably read in high school. World would be much kinder and happier.

  In practical terms life is like a passing parade and we are all children fascinated by the pomp and ceremony of the unfolding drama. Some of us get caught up in what has already passed us by and cannot see what should be plainly visible before our eyes. Others anticipate the coming events and miss the actual parade entirely. Mr Tolle says simply enjoy the parade as it proceeds, not as it was or as it will be. (...) A few critics claim he does not reference great books of the past or that his ideas are old stuff being rehashed. What they do not seem to understand is that they are not the only parade watchers. The part of the parade they have seen might be old to them but it is new to others and has not even begun for some. The entire parade is always unfolding ""Now"" even though each spectator sees it from his or her own particular viewpoint. Truth, wisdom, realizations and revelations, no matter where or when they first appeared are never old in themselves. They only seem old when the time bound mind looks back, and they are of no value whatsoever unless and until they are brought up to the Now and experienced in the Now. The ancient truths explained in ""The Power of Now"" are as new today as they have ever been or will ever be. Mr. Tolle presents them in plain and simple terms, easily understood by those with eyes to see and/or ears to hear. Events in the parade of life pass by us continuously. Some disappear into yesterday and seem to be lost in time. Others, frolicking in the playground of the wandering mind, called imagination, may appear to be coming tomorrow. But the actual parade, your own Parade of Life, mine, and Mr. Tolle's is unfolding now. Once we realize that time does not exist in the past or future we can experience the joy of our passing parade as it unfolds infinitely and eternally. Life is the only real event that is happening, and it is happening now. Mr. Tolle explains this in a most excellent way. The Power of Now cannot change your life. Nothing can alter perfection. But it can change your life situations if you let it. The book is excellent.

  If you've got a lot of ""noise"" running around your mind, like myself and many others, this book is a smart choice.  The ""noise"" I speak of is the endless stream of thoughts, hypothetical conversations, and worry about this, that, or the other thing.The book's Q & A format is great because if you're reading this review, and interested in this book (or the self-help genre in general), then you have questions and are seeking answers and solutions.  The Power of Now definitely provides a lot of answers and explanations.  The ""solutions"" you'll have to come up with on your own.  They differ from one person to the next and should become clear as you digest the information within.Depending on your personal belief system and/or religious practices, some of the realities explored in the book may seem a little ""out there"" or ""new age-ish"".  My advice is just keep an open mind.  There was nothing in this writing that seemed off, wrong, or  insulting to my personal beliefs.  That may be because the very ""religious"" upbringing I was force-fed always seemed ""off"" to me, but I had little choice in my younger years.  My point is we're not exactly taught the ""truth"" growing up, or exploring life as an adult (about a great many things).  The intent of this book seems to shine a light on that fact rather well.  Whether or not it is something you're *ready* to learn about is up to you.If you're already on the ""path of enlightenment"", there may not be anything truly new in The Power of Now, but what it has to offer, it does very well, in my opinion.  In my case, it spelled out and reinforced many truths and realities I already felt deep down inside but struggled to bring into my consciousness.It's been very helpful to me and may be to you, too.  Keep in mind the book only contains information.  Any difference in your life it makes will be in how you *apply* the knowledge, not in simply having it.  In other words, if you're seeking help with something in your life, you need to do the work in order for positive change to happen.  Understanding alone will not cut it.  That's just my personal advice, not something the book gets into.I've already recommended this to a couple of friends in my life and now I'm doing the same for you.

  This is a great book for anyone who wants to change their life and especially so for those who are caught up in their thoughts in a daily basis and would like that to stop.  Like the subtitle of the book says, it's a guide to spiritual enlightenment, but even if you aren't interested in that I still recommend getting the book. This book explains how our rambling thoughts and our engaging with them (which causes more thoughts to form) has negatively affected our lives in so many ways. He also explains how this is not how life is supposed to be. We are able to turn our minds off when we don't need it.I am currently rereading the book. It is not a book that you can just read once.  You have to go over it a few times and will probably have to refer to it during the course of your life. But don't just read it over a number of times, you must put it into practice.  That's the best way to use this book.As to those who have said the author has a condescending tone, he doesn't. Just listen to the audio version of the book and you'll see. As for those who think the pain-body only applies to people who have gone through a traumatic experience, it is not.  He explains what the pain-body is in the chapter on the pain-body so I won't explain it here. An example would be someone who is very negative and dwells on the past or the person whose negativity blows up in anger a lot.  Those will be the more prominent signs of the pain-body. If you don't identify with having a pain-body, you are probably more balanced than others.

Amazing book and philosophy to know. However, this book is not easy to read, unlike some review I first read before I ever read this book. The way is written is not in simple terms or flow. I've learned that some people do not get it and loose interest. Use of ""big"" words and deep messages may appear out of order and loose you forcing you to re-read one paragraph. This book must be read with an open mind and slow, very slow; studied & even then, you will still go back to it and read certain sections. The message it's amazing and explained thoroughly.

  Despite being regarded as New Age or another of the self help books, I think Eckhart Tolle's Power of Now is a very important book. The message is as old as time, but no matter, and it's this: By being fully aware and appreciative of this moment, right now, in your life, being aware of how the world is to you in contact with your senses, you can learn to control your emotions and become positively indifferent or at peace with being in your own skin and dealing with your own ego or problems. A person's ego is a person's identification with his or her own thoughts. The person identifies himself or herself as a thinking thing and assumes that the inner monologue, the narrative self, is the true embodiment of who they are. But ultimately who you are is what you already possess, and what you already are: namely, a conscious being. Too often we get bogged down in everyday life, our habit and routines, and do not stop and literally and figuratively smell the roses. Instead we are trapped in our own interior monologue about what happened in the past, what unsettling event might happen in the future, or maybe we're looking at this moment and panicking. But ultimately, the message here is to make of life a series of mini-meditations, where you identify yourself as consciousness and let the world come to your senses and be at peace with the world. And this is something that is even more important than transitory happiness.Anyway, read it for yourself and reflect on what you think about it.

  One of the best books I've ever read, period. Useful for spiritual beginners or those who are more advanced.

  There are a lot of reviews on this site debating the truth of the teachings in the Power of Now, whether its statements are true, whether they are valid, whether they are boring, whether they are interesting.These reviews miss the point of the book. The book is an introduction to a practice - a practice of being in the present, of being centered and still. It gives you the tools to look at your mind, and by looking at the mind, be identified with the awareness that is watching the mind - what Tolle calls the watcher. The more one can do this, the more they find their life improving, and a deeper connection with source, the spirit, their deeper self.The words of the book are not perfect. The arguments against or for the book and the way the content is presented may have validity. But again, they miss the point. The point is to *use* the tools presented in the book and see what happens to your life, to uncover a deeper meaning to your reality. Without practice, the book is simply another ""interesting book"", with which the ego mind can judge, evaluate, criticize, adore, adulate, admire etc. for its own reasons.Put the principles of the book into practice in your life, and then you will *see* the value of the book, its simplicity, power and truth.

  One of the most important books we have today. Rising above the ego and our thinking mind is the next step in our human evolution. Although thought had served us well in inventing and being clever minded, we have gone too deeply into our heads and our stories, and have trapped ourselves into unconsciousness. It's time to evolve and awaken the higher mind, an idea many teachings of the east have been trying to get across for thousands of years. This book gives the same kind of peace you would find reading the Tao. I have great respect for Eckhart Tolle and his teachings have touched millions. This is a simple book and yet is so very profound. Thank you.

  funny that I am writing this review because I had this book a while and i read it but I was reading it with my ego. Ekhart should win something like a noble peace prize or something because this book is life changing. I dont even know where to begin so I can tell you personally what I have been doing. When he speaks off the ego, he means it comes in many diferent shapes and form. It can be a ego of pain, anger, desire, basically anything. basically the ego something you have developed your sense of self around. and it can get really worse if you keep feeding it. By meditating and prayer for an answer I found the root cause of my problem and birth of my ego and I relize I been feeding for 22 years. I dont really want to get into much detail about it because It really is indescrible. I been praticing to disolve the pain body, which can become bigger the more you feed it(ego) making it harder to disolve it. Sometimes I slip back into the pain from the past, but i am soooo much more close to Essense, GOD or spirit just by now knowing.So I defently reccomend this book

  E. Tolle's own reading of his work is well worth the purchase and investment in hearing, again and again.  His voice carries a presence and cannot be described only experienced.  The book is a wonderful read, but it invites the intellect, the mind, to intercede, interpret, contradict and to allow the reader to miss an underlying truth running like a gentle stream throughout the work.  Tolle's own reading, however, carries the reader like a fallen leaf, gently floating, observing and sensing the stream beneath and the world around.I listened to these tapes continuously on a three day cross-country drive.  And they have not been out of my vehicle during my daily 2 hour commute.  I have heard new things with each listening.  I have seen 'new' things in each commute. Perhaps I was simply ready, but hearing this has changed me and it has begun to change my life.

  I first read this book last summer, and if you'd have asked me what I thought of it then, I'd have given it 5 stars.  I fell for all of the mumbo jumbo, though I didn't put it into practice.  But, when I started rereading it the other day, I realised the destructive potential of this book, and the ideology that rests behind it.Simply put, Eckhart Tolle advocates living in 'the Now', which is his repetitive term for the present.  This is perhaps the only good idea of the book.  Unfortunately, Tolle steals absolutely everything beautiful about living in the now with the rest of the book.Firstly, he teaches us to disconnect from our thoughts and emotions, and our 'egoic' sense of self.  However, he doesn't actually term how we should do this.  In proper mindfulness (something which I ascribe to), it is taught not to physically disconnect yourself from thoughts and emotions, but to accept that they are part of you, and to feel them and enjoy them as part of life.  This is beautiful.  Tolle, however, seems to be of the opinion that thoughts are awful.  You want to be in the state of 'no mind', he repeats regularly.  If I was constantly in the state of 'no mind', how would I remember my girlfriend's birthday, or what time I had to get up in the work in the morning, and so on?  How would I remember to be compassionate to other people?  How would I decode and tackle different situations?  Clearly, this idea of 'no mind' is completely ridiculous.  One can accept that they have some thoughts that they have no control over, and that negative/intrusive thoughts may not reflect reality, but to get rid of them is simply a ludicrous and potentially damaging idea.  If someone walks around constantly trying to clear their mind of thoughts, then they're not concentrating on the Now are they?  They just get more lost in a losing battle with their own minds.Secondly, disconnecting from the emotions is also a dreadful idea.  If one disconnects from the emotions, then how are they meant to feel love, and awe, and pride, and joy?  At the end of the day, like it or lump it, 'love and joy' does not come from your 'spirit'.  Here's the science: they are made by hormones that are created by your glands and organs, that affect different parts of your body in different ways.  Example given: foxes have emotions.  I doubt they're particularly 'spiritual' animals, and I also doubt that they have different ways of communicating philosophy in fox talk.  They don't think words either, but they do remember to have children, and to eat and drink, and to sleep.  This is because their emotions tell them to.So I would completely counter Tolle by saying that you should always listen to your emotions.  You should open up to them and accept them as part of you.  That doesn't mean you should act on them, for example taking out anger on someone else.  But always listen to them.  Why do I feel anger?  Why do I feel fear?  And then: should I go with this emotion, or should I let it go?  Your emotions are trying to tell you something, they're trying to improve your life and help you to exist.  You can think about them in the wrong way with your mind, but fear wants to keep you alive.  Attraction wants you to have children.  Joy wants you to feel rewarded.  Emotions are sending you messages.  Don't block them out: listen to them.The final problem that I have with this work is that we should all be passive.  If somebody does wrong on the planet, for example if Putin dropped two nuclear bombs on the United Kingdom tomorrow, then we should approach them with a passive mindset, and try to get them to right their wrongs by helping them to find their 'inner spirit'.  What a ridiculous idea this is.  If Putin dropped two bombs on the United Kingdom tomorrow, then he should be reprimanded!  He should be viewed as a criminal!  It seems that Tolle has got the wrong end of the 'non-judgement' stick.  To me, 'non-judgement' means viewing the situation in the truthful way that it is, and then finding an assertive, and not a passive, way to deal with said situation.  By doing this, we improve people's lives, and don't take a ridiculous, indifferent, uncaring attitude to everything that exists around us.In conclusion, the world would be a pretty boring place if we sold our minds, our egos, our emotions, our assertiveness, our positive actions, our will to change the world.  We would probably walk around like a bunch of accepting cyborgs.  ""Oh, you spilled your drink on me.  Don't worry, I've accepted that that is now in the past.  Let us continue with our conversation while I focus on living in the moment.""  Or maybe Emperor Eckhart would like that, as he sits in his big mansion eating caviar, berating his servants who, of course, simply accept, passively, that that is there life situation.  Wake up people.  Life is proactive, not reactive, and if you want to live in the Now, then do it by going out and doing something, and not falling behind your own insecurities.And yes, my emotions are telling me frustration.  Yes, I went with them.  Eckhart: get over it.

  Tolle presents what has been presented by many others from a challenging and new point of view. I especially liked the question-answer format. It cuts right to the point and has no fluff. His style is straight forward, no mush. The book is basically in three parts: how he got here, his philosophy, how to apply his ideas.Some people want to cut right to part three, but I think the whole is better than the parts when you are first being introduced to his philosophy. I would urge people to read this book first and then go to the next ""Practicing"" later for something to carry around for easy referral.Like others have said, his work has changed my life - especially how I handle my relationships, letting go of things and living in forgiveness NOW.Overall, very powerful, but his words will only work for you if you are ready to hear them.

  I have experienced some of the best days of my life after reading this book. Days that beforehand would've been ordinary became enjoyable in every sense. Days which would have been stressful and caused anxiety in the past are now fine. It's not like the sensations are gone entirely, but more so as if there's a peace behind it all. More surprisingly so, whenever these feelings regarded as ""bad"" are welcomed, it's almost as if they vanish unintentionally. This is truly not a book for the ego - it's actually quite simple, but the practical knowledge gained from practicing mindfulness is by far the most important thing I have learned. Being mindful definitely takes practice and willpower but it's worth every second.

  Upon moving to New York City for a new life and job, I was thrust into a face-paced world that seemed to never stop. Endless opportunities for entertainment, great food, meeting people, and always being on and open for the newest adventure to experience.The Power of Now came into my existence the first month I was in New York. And thank goodness it did. I was already a person who lived very much in the past and the future, constantly thinking, worrying, and over analyzing everything. And New York is really a city that caters to that kind of thinking...and vice versa, people with that mindset can really feed off of NYC.Obviously, it doesn't really matter where you live to experience the Power of Now...but for me, NYC was relevant because I had just moved here when I found the book. And further, NYC is a very fascinating place which is why so many people chose to move here. But unfortunately, the prevalence of unconscious insanity is also ripe here, which is why so many people choose to leave.Ultimately, the Power of Now helped me realize that the past and the future are really just illusions. We tend to have ""selective memory"" of our pasts as the details get more and more fuzzy over the years. Further, our past is the source of Regret and Resentment.Our future hasn't happened yet...so ""what could happen"" is just educated speculation at best. Yet, the future of ""what could happen"" is the source of our Anxiety and Fears.Through the Power of Now, I have been able to become conscious of my past and future ""illusions"" which are fueled by thoughts. Thoughts that aren't really me. Being conscious of these illusions means I no longer unconsciously identify with these thoughts. Instead, I am just pure consciousness.It's very humbling to realize that my ego isn't really me...but instead just a mask that covers my true self. My true self being an eternal being which is forever in the NOW. A place where past and future illusions cannot to exist.As a result, I've been able to really embrace NYC with love and joy, to really see it for the wonderful and exciting place that it is, and have compassion for the unconsciousness that I continue experience around me...without letting it get me down. I live a life of pure acceptance of the Now.And I thank the Power of Now for helping me awake from my own unconsciousness.So, here's to staying humble, simple, and real.

  This book cuts to the deepest core of human existence. It talks from the place of truth that is at the foundation of what it is to be, planting seeds in that same vacancy that is shared for all humans, to sprout out individually in each reader/listener at his/her own pace, and place of being. I believe anyone who listens to this book could get something out of it. There is no way to know for sure what each person would get out of it, but being only mildly interested in ""understanding"" is a great indicator of finding it well worth it. I find the title to be a bit too long. I would just call it ""The Power"". Too much focus on any single entity is limiting, and seems to disregard the existence of other factions in existence. The book does speak about the power of living in the present moment. More specifically, it talks about the importance of ""living"", which just so happens to be in the moment, at any given moment, whether one chooses it or not. This book is not meant to be an effort of scrunching your brain to understand any concepts. On the contrary, it flows from deep within and brings a sense of peace that I believe a part of all people desires. Again, all it requires is a bit of willingness to understand, and skepticism is welcome. Its source may even be identified in the course of listening. Eckhart's voice is enchanting and drawing, and the character and soul of the book as conveyed through his voice probably conveys the heart of the matter much more strongly than simply reading it. But I find this would be a rich resource in any shape it takes.

  This books extracts knowledge from revealed scriptures, takes out sectarianism, and attempts to presents the truth as it is. There are several references to the Bible, Sufism, Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, Zen etc. this is not to convert anyone from their nameplate faith, but to help you find the real self that is hidden underneath the gross and subtle bodies.

The book is easy to read as content is based on real-life questions from others.  It is appropriate for anything a person could be seeking: relaxation, relief from physical or emotional pain, and has many examples of how to live a simple life.

  This book has transformed my consciousness and how I view consciousness.  I have read it many times and will again in the future.  It continues to unfold its wisdom and transnational power with each reading.  Other books have supported me in challenging my belief systems.  But, The Power Of Now has gone far beyond any book or Spiritual Teacher that I have so far encountered.Accessing this timeless space of Now where the past does not exists and the future is yet to come.  Its not that I have forgotten the past, but being present to stillness opens me to aspects of awareness that I was did not have access to before.Take a look and see for yourself what may be useful to you.

  This book was recommended over a period by various people from house people to inmates. I have a list of souls I started 2 years ago to discuss and share Conversations with God. Now I just send out what I feel at the time may be appropriate from what I receive and occasionally my own thoughts. It is no longer centered on discussions of CWG.CWG and many other works are more invitations to consider while this book not only does that but invites the reader to apply in very simple ways methods that may result in change in consciousness.This book is aptly titled but will put off many. If one can take their mind out of it and be as objective as they know how it can provide some simple concepts to look at and perhaps apply.I know it has helped me remember my Now. There is no-thing else.As I am also involved with a metaphysical outreach for inmates where I can and I will recommend this book to them. As you can all imagine being an inmate invites many different methods of coping. Inmate or not this book may help many.Be Blessed

  I didn't like this book the first time I got it out of the library. I found Tolle to be a pompous know it all. I read only a chapter and returned it to the library. Months later I took a long trip in my car and took out of the library the unabridged CD's read by Tolle.  I listened to the whole thing and really enjoyed it. Upon my return I purchased the book and am slowly working my way through it. Tolle has taken an Eastern idea (Mindfulness), and presented it in a Western manner (Now). It struck a chord with me, unlike all other books I have bought and read on this Eastern idea. I highly recommend it!

  Nothing is by mistake when it comes to unseen links to spiritual awakening and guidance.  It is a plan beyond human understanding yet, this author, Eckhart Tolle has by his own experience and sought after guidance in the spiritual realm has more than put in words of our understanding the 'wake up and smell the coffee' approach to seeking and living in the God-given, Universe-given mortality of humans and the essence of immorality in the living world through absolute acceptance of 'what is' and the present and presence of any given ""Now"" moment of unadulterated freedom.  I recommend this book of life, lessons, teachings, reeducation of the gift of self to read, absorb and feel the passion of you that harbors the mask of life in mind made and projected terms.  Read with an open-mind even if at first, there may be skepticism.  You will find more than yourself in terms and labels to move past the mind!

  Absolutely revolutionary approach to how we see time and life itself. My eBook copy is full of highlights and notes from passages that seemed to be written expressly for me. I read it while travelling abroad and it was particularly powerful while exploring new places and challenging my beliefs about what's ""normal"" in everyday life.It's important to note that this book is not a textbook nor a strategy guide. It addresses the deeper underlying assumptions and beliefs that we hold, helping to open the reader's eyes to a different way of thinking and appreciating the moments in which we find ourselves. That said, there were many passages that resonated deeply with me, but I was left wanting more to put the insights into practice. This is where it's useful to check out Tolle's ""A New Earth"" for more practicable insights.Overall, I'd call this book an entryway into a new way of thinking. Tolle pulls back the curtain on an understanding that lies just beyond where we normally live, and it's up to the reader to step through the doorway and explore that space for him or herself, and discovering the many other resources to help one find their place in all of it.

  Eckhart Tolle's ""The Power of Now"" is one of the best books written for self improvement.  Each sentence is powerful, well worded and easy to understand.  ""The Power of Now"" focuses on the importance of keeping your full attention on the ""present"" moment (on what is occurring right now) and not letting your mind dwell on past events or obsess with the future.  Eckhart Tolle helps the reader realize the many tricks the mind can play to avoid ""the now"" and describes how they are exhibited through symptoms of suffering, pain, hostility, anger, fear, complaining, longing etc.  The author thoroughly examines how these problems are created and offers methods throughout the book on how to overcome them and become more conscious.  This book has helped many recover from traumatic events and is one of the best places to start freeing your mind.The audio CD set of ""The Power of Now"" is great to have if you can't sit and read.  The book is read by the author Eckhart Tolle who has a distinguished voice that quickly captures and holds your attention.  The CD set is enjoyable as well as informative, I highly recommend it.

  In the past perhaps you may have read many other New Age spirituality authors, felt the truth of their words, yet felt that they'd neglected to include something, something profoundly subtle yet essential that they either A) took for granted, or B) weren't aware of.As a result, while the previous books may have been informative, inspiring, and possibly even useful to some extent, somehow again and again, you found yourself right back where you started and wondering why and what you could do about it.If this sounds like you then Eckhart Tolle may be just the author you've been searching for all along.

  A book to ""Guide"" one to ""Spiritual Enlightenment"". A field guide of sorts. It either works or it doesn't, it gets you to where you'd like to be or you find yourself lost. In this case you can find your way and Eckhart Tolle explains it rather nicely. Not to say there isn't a point or two which could use a little simpler explanation, and why I'd consider giving the book 4 1/2 stars, but these concerned women more than men and being one and not the other perhaps I'm the one at fault and not Mr. Tolle. I am personally aware of some of the enlightenments spoken of in this book and can attest to their being valid. That's why, to me, this is a ""Good Book"".

  The Power of Now, Wow.This book is truly a gift from the CREATOR to all of us who ever have asked the questions, Why Im I here in this world? Why is there so much Hatred? Why am I not happy? This book explains every thing and the one thing we all need to know in order to free our selves from simply our self. This book is a way to freedom, finally I know I can stop searching now. Now it's time to do the work that's been layed out so simply Beautifully in this book from Heaven. I love the simplicity in how Eckhart Tolle takes you step by step through the process of dismantling all of the confusion that we've placed on our selves unknowingly. What you are left with after reading this book, I prefer the audio book for his voice seems to speaks directly to my heart, is simply no more EXCUSES. You either do the work that will set you free, or you can continue to do the work that will keep you in a form of self imprisonment. Let's not fool our selves,this world is a Beautiful place,The beauty represents the good in us. But it's the ugly that robs us and keeps us in fear. Thank God there is a way out, and you will be so amazed how simple it is after reading this wounderful book. It's time to clear the debris and reclam our whole true self back from this living dead state of mind into enlightment.

  I started this book 30 yrs. ago and put it down soon afterward. I thought he was kind of a spiritual snake-oil salesman. I was 50 yrs. old then. It has taken me all these years to understand what he is talking about. Of course, I had a firm, (Very firm,) idea of who I was and where I was going....Lucky I lived this long and can and do profit from it a great deal.....Hope other people are not as obtuse as I was.

  The more I read the more it is sinking in.  Is is actually fairly simple, but the concept of being present in the now is not what most of us do.

  If you worry to much and have periodic anxiety episodes this is the book for you. I bought the audio version and have listen to it twice. It may, as it did for me stop creating problems for myself. I though this book understand I spend too much time in the past and in the future. I now stay in the now and practice this concept everyday and it has reduced my level of anxiety and worry 90% and I hope if I keep using the practice of staying in the ""Now"" I will eliminate many issues I was creating for myself. Worth the money. I bought the other book by the author ""Practicing the Power of Now"". I walk everyday and look forward to learning how to stop poor mind control of miscellaneous messages from the mind that run all the time and eliminate everything that is not an issue ""now"".

  This book has been a blessing to me, and I think like many things - you get out of it what you put into it! Many times, I would find myself astonished at how situations being described were 100% dead-on and relative to my same experiences. Once you realize how stuck we become in learned patterns, you realize that change is in order and this book is a great start into finding your own reality and peace. There are times you may need to read passages and even chapters over and over again until it makes sense or sinks in. In fact, as soon as I was done with my first read, I immediately started over again. I bought this 3 months ago and I am on my 3rd time through - each time you will grasp more and challenge yourself to accept new ways of perceiving things. When I am overly stressed, I will pick it up and just read until I feel calm again.

  This can be a profound, life-changing book for some people. I am saddened but not surprised by the negative reviews here. Some people are not ready to hear Eckhart's message, or it is not written in a way that speaks to them. It is somewhat paradoxical, really, because one reason they cannot hear it is that they are run by their minds, which is what the book aims to address. In short, Tolle makes eastern spirituality accessible to westerners.When I first encountered Tolle, I must admit the book changed me in significant ways. Now, looking over it after years have passed, I find myself thinking, ""Duh."" But that is really a kudo to him - I ""got it"" and no longer need the teacher. Indeed, I have referenced this book a couple of times in my own:

  For Me, the first several chapters make this one of  the best books I have ever read.  However, after a while ET sort of lets his Ego get out of control and starts theorizing and pontificating beyond Buddha and i think he might have lost it.I am not proposing ET to be the new Messiah, a genius of original thought, or the creator of a new religion.  The PoN is a pragmatic rehash of Buddha principals which I find very secular and pragmatic.  Like many, I have toyed with, bought books, etc re Buddha principles and meditation etc.  After going through several of the bestselling books it just did not stick to my wall, so to speak.  This is where ET shines.  This is a very well written, easy to read pragmatic book, which I highly recommend to all, particularly the modern American Yuppie or other that feels harried by our fast paced lives, chauffeuring the kids from one event to the other, the BMW payments, a boss who should be in The Far Side and / or Dilbert and the rest of the modern pressures.  Buy it NOW; you won't be able to put it down, although you are supposed to chronically to contemplate the principles.  It may not change the direction of your Ship by 90 degrees but may help you enough to make a meaningful short term and material long term difference.Highly Recommended!

  It has to be savoured over a longtime in order to be digested properly. Tolle's theories imply such complete control over one's mind and emotions that they need re-reading over and over. If accepted, they can give us peace and harmony, while still functioning as modern human beings in a modern world, by deflating one's over-inflated ego and by explaining how our mind really works and what job it is really there to do.

  I can honestly say this book has completely changed my life.  I was going to leave my husband and my life and move to California, because I wasn't content and couldn't get out of my head.  After reading it, I am content, happy, at peace and excited that I am choosing to stay with the man I love.  He is thrilled with my transformation.  I don't complain and want to live.  Before I also really didn't care if I died, because in my mind, I had nothing to live for.  I was in such a dark place.  After reading the first 20 pages, I was blown away.  I've heard the phrase ""live in the moment"" countless times, but the way Eckhart Tolle wrote about it and kept reinforcing the point, it finally sunk in.  I don't have to worry about the past or future.  I can enjoy now and deal with it or change what I can.  I am so happy that my sister introduced me to this book. I cannot give it enough praise.

  This book exceeded my expectations. Two thoughts expressed by Tolle helped me a great deal. Firstly when he says in the first chapter that  words are just signposts pointing to some else, so don't get hung up on the level of words:  if you don't like one word, just substitute some other word that you identify with. second is his explanation of surrender without resignation in the last chapter.

  The message is fabulous! A great source of help and insight for everyone ...especially those on a spiritual journey. Eckhart is a little difficult to follow sometimes because of his accent and his use of words. (or could be that I am just a beginner at spiritual understanding)  I had to replay parts several times to understand. Still, it is well worth it! And, frankly I don't think it would have been the same if someone other than Eckhart would have narrated the book.

  Very Buddhist approach to life and living--I recommend and give this book to friends who are stressed out or worried, and it has helped many of them realize that we live not in the past or the future, but in this very moment...it's the only one we have. A bit redundant and repetitive in parts, but the points are reiterated for a purpose, perhaps...one ""gets it"" from several sides.

  Tolle describes a single-pointed method for waking up. Although simple, the ""Power of Now"" is not easy. Yet Tolle provides several conditions, ways, and rationales to nudge the reader toward awareness of the present moment, and letting go of false and unconscious ego attachment. His authority comes from his own experience; not from an ideological position, which makes his description highly compelling.

I would recommend reading as opposed to the audio, just because it's somewhat dense. Definitely take your time with it. There are little breaks in the passages for you to stop and meditate on.

  I lived with negativity in my life for years: grievances, fear, anxiety, panic, etc.  I became a self-help junkie and immersed myself in a ton of self-help/personal growth material.  I read one book after another. I listened to audio programs.  It was a continous cycle that lasted almost four years.  ""The Power of Now"" broke that cycle.I was so identified with mind that I read the book once but it really didn't hit home with me.  But it was as if a small seed was planted in me (as described in the book).  I started practicing presence little by little and noticed profound positive changes.  And then I decided to read the book a second time around.  It was at that point that I really started getting amazing results.Why was I a self-help junkie?  I wanted to let go of negative energy and be at peace.  Out the numerous books I read, ""The Power of Now"" was the only book that allowed me to FULLY let go of negative energy and experience peace for the first time in well over a decade.Tolle points out that unless you're really fed up with suffering, you won't make that choice to become more present-oriented and thus be more at peace.  I was a self-help junkie because I was fed up with the intense negativity in my life.  I continued practicing presence and out of the blue, totally unexpected, I had what you may call an enlightenment experience.  I read the book again for the third time due to the experience.  I was so amazed.  I had a deeper understanding of what Tolle was talking about, particularly in Chapter One.  The first two times I read the book, I didn't understand what he was getting at because I never had the experience.  But after having that experience, those words TOTALLY made sense.  And I can't imagine any author expressing that any more crystal clear than Tolle.I've had conversations with many people about this book. It seems to me that this book will hit home most with those who have suffered big time.  Whereas people who don't have it so bad will lack the motivation to look into this.

  I wasn't going to write anything, but some of these other reviews have compelled me to do so.  People are criticizing Tolle for, what they seem to think is, idealism and hoopla and logical falicies.  But this book holds no such things.  Someone actually wrote a critical review because ""it doesn't work.""  That is sad, because this reader missed the whole point of this book.  This book is not a quick fix, nor does it claim to be.  IT IS A WAY OF LIVING.  Yes, Tolle claims his method will change your life, but he does not claim that you will be able to exercise the Power of Now effectively as soon as you put down the book.  That impatience is precisely what the book is trying to alleviate. Just like yoga and meditation (which this book is very close to and works very well with) this is a lifelong practice.  For example, try concentrating on the next 10 breaths you have  Follow the breath in. Follow it out.  Don't think about them, just notice them, without one other thought entering your mind.............yeah, it's hard as hell. But wouldn't it be nice?  That is where this book can take you, but you must not look at your inability to complete this task as a fallacy of this book.  Taking Tolle's advice rather, fully accept where you are in the process at this time, right now.  And I have to defend Tolle's comment that gays and women are closer to enlightenment than heterosexual men, which was criticized in a review below mine.  They aren't closer to enlightenment simply because they are gay or because they are female, and no, Tolle doesn't claim God has something against straight guys.  Women and gays TEND to be closer to enlightenment because MOST of the time women and gays are more in touch with there feelings, and less likely to suppress them and try to be ""tough,"" like the stereotypical straight American male. Can anyone argue with that?  And I have to address the criticism of Tolle for his concept that this very moment is outside of the realm of time (past and future).  You can only argue with this if you are not in this moment.  Sure, we all now that every minute is a part of time, part of a past and future, but if you are truly IN this moment, you cannot have a concept of past and future, which in essence means that you are not in the grasp of the past and future, you are ""free of time.""  For example, when you tried the breathing exercise above, if you had even one breath of pure presence, you know what I am talking about, there is a freedom in each moment. I know it is hard to grasp, for me as well, but I urge you, especially the person who wrote that comment, to continue trying, because although I have only had glimpses, there is nothing like the feeling you get when you truly experience this very moment, with all of its wonder, with every sound, with every feeling, with every sight.  We have been given and infinite supply of these moments, and this book at least helps us find a way to appreciate them.  This book has begun to change my life.  It also led me to the book ""wherever you go, there you are,"" which is also a life-changing read. Hope this helped you out a little. Good luck.

  The author acknowledges that this knowledge is derived from many ancient sources, Hindus, Buddhists, the Chinese, the Bible etc.  But his examples are poor and difficult to follow.  At some points he expresses anger at the harm the human race has done to fellow humans and the planet.  This appears contradictory when his message is to ""observe oneself as if detached"" - in which case you would apply no blame and feel no anger.Simply put, the author is re-wording ancient wisdom that says:Be objective in your awareness.  By being objective you have detached yourself from the situation and hence will not feel anger, hate, jealousy and countless other emotions that would have flooded you had you been subjective.  By being objective you will be clear minded and make the right decision.  Had you stayed subjective, you would make an emotionally clouded judgment simply to satisfy your ego.  And the best way to be objective is to be selfless in all actions.And so I give this book a thumbs up as a contribution to a more positive humanity but I feel the author could have simplified his message and presented better examples to make the truth more concrete.

  ... If you read Power of Now with your mind, you probably won't finish it.  If you do as Eckert says and not get hung up on the words, they will pass right through your mind and kindle your spirit.The downside of the book is that it removes all excuses - now that we know, we must act.  I believe that this book has ushered in the ""New Age"" - it will be the catalyst that gives humanity the strength to raise it's consciousness.  Groups will form, energy will concentrate, others will be attracted.  Many spiritual teachers speak of a planetary transformation during the generation beginning in the eighties.  It would indeed be a transformation if we all lived in the Now.  No more madness....  Now that I think of it, get the tapes and listen to his voice.  The sounds make the words vibrate, and are more likely to pass through your brain.  I was going to say ""read it, you won't be disappointed"", but I can't since apparently many have been.  It's one of those ""love"" ""hate"" things - not much neutral.Give it a shot - what have you got to lose.  Just your mind, that's all.

  I rate this book a four because it has many beautifully stated gems about the spiritual life that are most likely based on the author's genuine interior experience.  When he stays within his own experience of reality, I think he writes well and brings to life some difficult to understand spiritual ideas.On the other hand, Eckhart Tolle inserts some opinions that could use more examination.  These are referenced by other reviewers and I see no need to repeat what they have already highlighted.The perspective I would like to add is that despite this book's shortcomings, it is genuinely inspirational in many ways.  It clearly describes what living in the moment means and in places the elucidation of difficult concepts is brilliant.  I think for the ideas that it does explain well, it merits a high rating.I also think it is important to distinguish between another's interior experience vs. an analysis of objective reality as understood by science.  This book is more like poetry than science, but sometimes poetry can shed more light on an important topic.  However, poetry is not as ""tight"" as mathematics and therefore, one must accept a trade-off between depth and certainty.I wouldn't rely on this as a one size fits all text.  However, it is very thought provoking and certainly worth serious consideration for the many topics it handles beautifully.  On the other hand, one should read critically and compliment this book with other opinions from different angles.I love the expression that truth is not an idea, it's a state of consciousness.  This book takes this as a tacit starting point and writes from a perspective of full engagement with reality.  I'm sure you will get many useful insights from it, even if you are annoyed by some of its shortcomings.

  I have found many answers for entire-life situations in this book; both, spiritual and practical questions: Is it  possible to understand the concept of God? Why does good and evil exist? Are the announcements of the ending of the world true?, How should we interpret them? Is it possible to become a ""saint"" in this world/in this life? What is the root cause of stress? Why do relationships break down? Why is there so much pain and conflict in relationsihips nowadays? Is there a right way to mantain a healty relationship? Does true love realy exist or is everything about chemistry, biological and psycological laws?. So I am learning how to practice emotional and mental health on a daily basis from this book. I recommned The Power of Now to everybody, not only for the answers you will find there, but because it is focused on modern life and its circumstances.

  Enjoyed the simple phrasings Tolle uses for some often expressed (and often over-complicated) concepts. It was a little ""positive/negative frequency vibration""-y for me at times, but this was rare. For the most part, the truths resonated well, and definitely will ring in my head for a while.

  I read this AFTER I read his book A New Earth.  So, I liked this book but got more out of the other.  I would recommend you start there (A New Earth).  But, I will say that the ""power of now"" concept (it's in both books) COMPLETELY changed my life the second I read it.  You start right now implementing the concepts because that is all you have!  So simple and logical - I guess that is why the general population is missing it...people are always trying to make things so complicated.  One of the best things I noticed was an instantaneous change in my children's behavior!  Nothing can put a price on that!

  I would hate to see a couple of negative spotlight reviews dissuade anyone from considering this book. Some people connect with it, some don't.  The Power of Now has made a HUGE difference in my life. Since I first read this book two years ago, my mind activity and emotions have substantially calmed and my underlying resistance level has dropped. My relationship with my wife has gone from gridlock to a sense of newness and discovery. I have ocassionally shifted into a state of awareness I can only describe as peace, grace, or presence.  Tolle cautions readers from the start not to conceptualize the material and try to create more ""mind stuff"". There's nothing in this book to learn, memorize, believe, or not believe. The words themselves have the power to awaken consciousness in those who are ready and open.  This is the most powerful book I have ever read and has been truly liberating for me. Thank you, Eckhart Tolle.

  Strangely, I find that this book should be published after the original ""The Power of Now"". In my opinion, this book should be the introductory book as the original is deeper and more difficult to understand for a person who is new to this field. There is a similar concept to Buddhism and hence I could relate to this book better. I am sure this book, if read in the serenity of night or in a conducive environment, would benefit the reader a lot.

  Growing up Protestant, I struggled with doctrine but could never quite admit that God didn’t exist. This book bridges the gap on understanding spiritual teachings more deeply as well as HOW to achieve it. God is definitely real - too big to contain in any one religion or book. The Power of Now is as close as it gets.Compelling stuff.

  Eckhardt Tolle writes books you should read periodically.  They contain basic life skills and reminders you need to bring you back to center.  This book is no exception. It really shows the value of living here and now - not looking backward with regrets or looking forward with worry. Many of us get so caught up in the past or future that we forget to really LIVE. Next thing you know, life has passed you by. I highly suggest you take the time to read this book!

  There are so many reviews here, I'll keep it brief.This book is far and away the best book on mindfullness that I know.The key to the book is that it makes mindfullness and meditation accessible.So many other mindfullness books make it seem like drudgery, and ""difficult"".I am not saying that attaining the highest levels of meditation is easy, just that it is relatively easy to achieve modest levels, and let it grow from there.I would also recommend ""A New Earth"", also by Eckhart.Jon Kabat Zinn's books are also not bad, but I don't find them as accessible at Tolle.

  I've read this book quite a few months ago, but its message changed my life. I've always been so heavily focus on my future and my past that I had a lot of trouble simply living the moment. ""The Power of now"" helped me change that, and now I live a much more intense life, simply by trying my best to focus on the present.It may sound like a simple and even silly solution, but it's much easier said than done (I, for one, am still on training wheels).This is a great book, well worth your time and money.

  Eckhart explains how living in the moment translates into practice of everyday with just about every situation. My best quote so far as the question is asked about how one can live in the moment in regards to future goals--makes no sense. He replies something like this: ""Even though it's important to know the direction in which you are heading, the only thing that is absolutely real about the future is what you do now"". I think it's important to have some basic knowledge about mindfulness before reading this book.

  This book contains enough wisdom to last a lifetime. In fact, if one could choose a book with which to be stranded on a desert island, I'd vote for The Power of Now.  Eckhart Tolle clearly has a deep understanding of the mystic life and the ability to express it in a simple and straightforward fashion, with a wry humor as well.The book is universal so that readers of all religions and those without any religious orientation can equally benefit.  A truly inspiring work that will be read and re-read and capable of effecting change in lives, and thus in the larger world. You'll find your copy dog-eared and a favorite companion.Highly recommended. A great gift for those seeking a deeper understanding of their lives.

  I first learned of ECKHART TOLLE  on Super soul Sunday Oprah's program.  Really  taken in by it so I ordered the Power Of NOW.  Amazing, Brilliant and helpful.  It's really a book of awakening.  Of seeing your world and actions in a different way.  Understanding about your Ego.  Helping you be more in the present and not in the past or focusing on the future as we all tend to be.  Chapter 8 about relationships is enlightening.  Really!

  This and Eckhart Tolle's follow up book, A New Earth, are both great! I prefer this over the more recent one. I think A New Earth got more exposure and hype because it was on Oprah and such a big Skype discussion for several of her shows. But this one, The Power of Now, was easier for me to grasp and didn't seem as repetitive. A New Earth, basically said the same things this book said, in a different way. The Power of Now is the better read in my opinion. You can also try listening to it on audio book.

  This work has many of the now typical hallmarks of the new age spiritual movement and the voice of the author pulls the listener right in to the work.  I immediately wanted to give this work my complete attention.  One of the fundamental conflicts I experienced in listening is that I was very tempted to intellectualized what I heard and frankly, doing so is contrary to the point.  This isn't a book you can just listen to and relax.  You have to take it bit by bit, practice what the author suggests and really allow yourself to experience being absolutely present in the current moment.  As the author intends, experience the now even as you listen without trying to figure it all out and categorize what you've heard.  I listened while I drove but the soft, soothing tone of the author's voice might make doing so unadvisable.

  The Power of Now teaches the importance of living here... and now... Life is a gift... that is why we MUST learn to live in the present. The message by the author, Ekhart Tolle is simple; if we learn to live each day at a time, we find the path to happiness and enlightenment. If we concentrate on the gift that each day of life represents, our thoughts and emotions would not get in the way of living in genuine peace and happiness. Sincerely recommend the reading of this book for anyone and everyone in search of the right and the obligation of aspiring to be happy. Other cultures live their lives without so much concentration on the worry of tomorrow. They live each eay at the time, guided by the forces at play that surround them, just like the ancient navigators allowed themselves to be guided by the stars. The identity of each individual is manifested by the moment they are living, rather than who they were... or whom they aspire to become. The author challenges us to understand that  our concern with anything else but our present lives, fills us with stress because our minds attempt to control the events that surround us, and that is just not possible. Introspective exercises are offered... and while we may not agree, or be capable of change, the thinking process does indeed get challenged enough for an indepth analysis of our lives.

  This is a wonderful book about being present more often in one's life, and not falling prey to worries about the future and regrets from the past to unleash the opportunity and power of 'now'.  Tolles uses a Q and A format to great advantage to his style, which is direct, powerful, and blunt.  His passion for the subject shines through in his brilliant focus, the crux of which is all there is is 'now' - but that 'now' contains in it everything, including forever.  Tolles approach is a logical and an almost scientific look at the notion of 'now' and consciousness to the 'now'.Anyone can benefit from this book, and his style is passionate and stirring.  I just completed the book, I strongly suggest that you follow his ""stop signs"" and read the book with the idea of experiencing what you just read.

  I've gained a lot from this.  Like any inspirational speaker, this is his perspective from his life experience.  Take from it what resonates with you and allow the rest to be just what it is, Eckhart's perspective.

  This isn't the kind of book you can read like you can a murder mystery, or an encyclopedia.  It's not meant to be quoted like a reference, either.  It is best to read the book in small pieces, then to meditate on what you feel inside (don't label the feeling, just experience it) based on it.Probably the best sign of the book's value is this:  The more I re-read passages in the book over the years, the more I get from the same passages.It helps remind readers of what truly matters---the sense of inner peace, joy and abundance, by pointing the way to experience who you are beyond thought.If you want to change your life, this book can help you on your path.

  Aloha,I apologize for not getting this in one post!Eckhart states essentially that the mind is always causing problems, is always tricking you, and that the heart and body are always telling you the truth. This is a very odd distinction to make given that the mind, heart and body are one entity. And in that oneness, each element has its share of truth and falseness. It's unbalanced to soley focus on the mind as the villian.Also, Tolle states that in the years to come many women are going to experience full enlightenment during their menstration period. That whole section really left me scratching my head. In essence, if you follow his reasoning, gay women who are having their period have the greatest potential for enlightenment.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with being a gay women having their period. Yet Tolle's reasoning about how this relates to one's potential for spiritual advancement is nothing short of very, very, very bizarre.The cover of the book contains a quote of endorsement by Deepak Chopra, one of the most prominent and blatant charlatans of the past century. Chopra passes himself off as a spiritual teacher, when in truth he is simply an editor of eastern esoteric texts. He reads them, and then reduces it down to a reader's digest version for a western audience. There's no great insight of his own.  On top of that, Chopra then has turned these cliff notes of eastern mysticism into a multi-million dollar greedy business which seeks to take advantage of the spiritual vacumn found in the west.  While such capitalism may be the American way, one certainly must question the sanctity of such a greedy movement as it relates to the spiritual.Shouldn't we expect more out of spiritual leaders?Also, there are numerous reports on the web about the blatant abuses by Chopra towards his staff written by ex staff members.The point being, why has Tolle featured Chopra on the cover of his book? Why feature an example of what a spiritual teacher should not become? Just to sell more copies of ""The Power of Now""? One can only hope that Eckhart doesn't succomb to the greed that has toppled so many spiritual teachers. One can only hope.Ok, enough for now......

It did not contradict my religious beliefs but gave me additional insights and practical steps on reaching a state of inner peace and hightened consciousness that I could start practicing immediately.  I feel all of us can benefit from the teachings of Eckhart Tolle.  Having already heard ""A New Earth,"" this book goes back to how to live in ""The Now.""  With relevant references to the Bible and other theological works, Eckhart brought me to a fascinating place where serenity exists.  It can be available to anyone willing to listen.

As such, it can be helpful even for those who adhere to a religion, but it could enhance one's own religious practice.

  Eckhart teachings are based on The Three Principles paradigm of psychology with an emphasis on ""presence"". I already understood and have actual experience in my life of the perspective that he teaches from; but Eckhart's focus on presence, his phrasing of detail and elaborations like what he describes as ""the pain body"" have added significantly to my understanding. This extraordinary work has taken me to highs of consciousness like the first high of consciousness I achieved when I first came to understand and experience the Three Principles paradigm. Very very highly recommended.

  I would agree with other reviewers here in writing that Eckhart Tolle tends to repeat himself. The first half of the book is extremely useful in describing and explaining our true inner self, our Being and how to raise your consciousness by relying less on thinking and more on identifying with your unmanifested self. The tools include body scanning and awareness, mindfulness, observing thoughts and emotions and just ""Being"" in the style of Zen. A good portion of the book is dedicated to repeating the main theme: stay in the now, the mind is evil and is responsible for the deaths of 100 million people in the last century, time and space and self is an illusion, among other ideas. As someone who considers myself as a person in spiritual recovery the book offers many answers and provides tools I can use in addition to those I have taken from Buddhism, Christianity and the 12 Step literature. I take what works for me and leave the rest. I disagree that the mind is all bad, despite being the root of  many of my self made problems due to a pattern of destructive thinking, which by the way this book is excellent at providing an easy approach to silencing the self defeating mind. I still believe that the mind has its uses and has served me well at times. The mind may have created weapons of war and bred racism, nationalism, religious conflict and wars of all scale but it has also created the tools of peace and healing. I think Tolle should give the mind more credit than he does and assert that it has a ""dark side"" and a ""light side"", we are free to choose which to use and should be mindful of the tendency of the mind to create an ego that can get us into trouble. I was also confused to read about portals to the source. Death I thought would be the final portal open to all but those that resist it, that part of the natural order is to return to the source. The concept that at the point of death a portal to the other realm opens but very briefly and most people miss it seems ludicrous and puts far too much of a human slant on the mystery of death and transition. Tolle's interpretations of the teachings of Jesus are also interesting and worthy of further investigation. Other than that ""The Power of Now"" does not offer anything new that I have not already read in the last year in the dozen or so books on mindfulness, Zen, Christianity and spiritual recovery. I still enjoyed it and got a lot out of it but I don't view it as the burning lamp I was told it was and expected to find after reading some of the reviews here.

  Tolle presents a good perspective that isn't necessarily intuitive to anyone raised in Western society. His presentation makes it accessable and relatively easy to understand and assimilate. Though I suspect that few people will adopt his practices 100%, I believe that everyone would benefit from the concepts and incorporate those habits and practices that are valid for them in particular. In short, almost everyone will find some benefit from this read.

  I bought this book a few years ago but never made it past the first few pages. Somehow, I did't seem ready for the information for the longest time. I finally picked it up again and started reading. Now I am amazed about Tolle's insight and the way he can explain the 'unexplainable'. Keep an open mind while reading and just let it sink in. It's beautiful.

  This book was recommended to me. At the beginning I was not very sure about it since it seemed to develop slowly, but as I got into the middle of the book I started to enjoy it a lot.I really like the analogies that the author makes with different believes / religions in order to make his point.I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to learn how to live in the present and defeat the ghosts of the past and the future.

  This is a deeper look at the concepts I loved in ""Who is God, You Are,"" by Fiona Fay. It is sometimes a bit hard to understand and I really do not like the question/answer format. However I needed the additional emphasis/explanations on the Now to be freed from mind misery. I may not be there yet, but as Fiona said, it's a journey and YES I am seeing changes in situations when I let go and surrender! :) Definitely recommended.

  I had read The Power of Now when it first came out, many years back.  I was quite influenced by it then.  But there is something about being able to listen to Eckhart narrate it and to hear the teachings in it over and over that I find quite powerful.  It will probably save me $1000's in ""seeking"" answers through other programs and events!

  Eckhart Tolle's ""The Power of Now"" is one, if not the best, of the enlightening, personal development and inspirational books of our time. Not only are the examples of irrational behavior easily recognized, but the path to spiritual enlightenment is provided in the form of practical excercises and self examination. Together with his new book ""A New Earth"" these two books have the potentional of revolutionizing and awaking humanity before it is too late.

  This book sits on my night table and I consider it my bible. In fact, if they still put bibles in hotel rooms (or do they just do that in novels?), they ought to replace all of them with this book. I have to reread it every few weeks to pull me back from my gnawing, worrying, obsessing mind that is driven by fear and self-doubt to remind myself that in this very second, there is no problem. Each time I reread a few pages, I feel my mind-driven ""reality"" relax it's deathlike grip on me and I'm able to appreciate the present moment in all of it's beauty, peace and wonder.

  It might take a while to get through this book, even though it is only a little over two hundred pages, as it is pretty deep. But, it is a readily understandable kind of deep.The main point is that Enlightenment is attained through accepting the Now, the present, as it is. Nothing can happen, except in the Now, so the Now is all that really matters.Take a look!

  My wife and I have listened to this book over and over.  Each time we get another nugget. If you are ready and willing to ""wake-up"" to the truth and beauty of your own true Self, this book will help a great deal. It is couched in modern terminology, with a clear aim to help move past the false ""ego-self"". Life often seems to make no sense at all - this book helps see through all that. Not as the main text, but woven in, are a few quotes from Jesus and other spiritual masters I have never understood. They are clearly explained and I feel I understand them now. I suggest you get the audio copy.  Listening to some of the same things several times over has helped me get nuances I may have missed.

  It's like God put Eckhart in the most devastating point of life to create him into this brilliant master of peace. It's like his teaching is beyond human. This book has me thinking.

  I struggle with living in the moment, and this books is giving insight on how to do with with life examples. However, this is a book to thoughtfully read as many times as it takes for you to figure out what it means in your life; this book shows you the way, but ultimately it up to you. Change takes time, and enlightenment happens when you are truly ready. The moment it happens your soul will know.
